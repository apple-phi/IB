Metals very useful in semiconductor technology. E.g. Schottky diodes.

## Evaporation
Can use thermal evaporation as a simple method to form thin metal layers.

- Metal at low pressure (semi-vacuum)
- Pass a current through to heat it up
- Place substrate nearby to evaporating molecules condense on it

The atom flux evaporating is given by a Boltzmann distribution where the activation energy is the per-molecule enthalpy of formation.

>Add in $\ce{O_{2}}$ to the vacuum to produce a metal oxide

Other ways to heat the metal includes:
- $\mathrm{e}^{-}$ beam
- laser heating
- $\mathrm{RF}$ induction heating

This process produces amorphous but rough layers.

## Sputtering

The most popular metallic layer formation method.

Ions of inert gas (e.g. Argon) are accelerated at a block of the feed material, which then knocks off and evaporates some feed atoms onto the nearby substrate.

The inert gas is accelerated by either
- High $\mathrm{DC}$ voltage to create plasma discharge (only for conducting feed materials)
- $\mathrm{RF}$ electric field—can use magnetic field too, this is *magnetron sputtering*

>Once again, add $\ce{O_{2}}$ or $\ce{N_{2}}$ to the inert gas to form oxides or nitrides respectively.

Define the sputter yield to be the ratio
$$
y_{s}=\frac{\text{atoms evaporated}}{\text{atoms incident}}
$$

### Pros
- More uniform and less rough layers

### Cons
- More expensive c.f. thermal evaporation
- Secondary $\mathrm{e}^{-}$ bombardment leads to excessive heating and defects
- Argon ends up in sample—makes it porous!
- Slow!

## Electroplating

Use electrolysis to create a metal layer.

Faraday law of electrolysis
$$
M=\frac{JA}{ZF}
$$
where $M$ is the metal mass growth per unit area, $J$ is the metal ion current, $A$ is the atomic weight of the metal, $Z$ is the metal valency and $F$ is the Faraday constant.

>Use an anode made from the feed metal so it automatically replenishes the solution feed ions!

Good at quickly making large layers. Use a polymer mask to grow high aspect ratio structures.

## Transparent conducting oxides

Let’s say we want a transparent conducting material. We can use TCOs like indium tin oxide.

This can be formed by reactively sputtering tin and indium in an $\ce{O_{2}}$ environment. Or, more easily, an alloy of the desired feed composition can be used in an $\mathrm{RF}$ sputtering system.
