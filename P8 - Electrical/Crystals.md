## Miller indices
A plane in $n$-dimensions can be described by a Miller index $\mathbf{m}\in\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ such that the plane will cut the axes at $\mathbf{r}=x_{i}\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{i}$ s.t.
$$
x_{i}=\frac{1}{m_{i}}
$$

### Example
A plane cuts the axes at
$$\mathbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}2\\4\\1\end{bmatrix},$$ so its uniquely defined Miller index is the ratio $\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, 1 \right),$ hence
$$\mathbf{m}=\begin{bmatrix}2\\1\\4\end{bmatrix}.$$
## Braggâ€™s Law

Electron diffraction reveals crystal properties. By impinging a high-energy electron beam on a crystal at an angle $\theta$ to the grain, the diffraction pattern has peaks at
$$
n\lambda=2d\sin\theta
$$
where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons and $d$ is the grain spacing.
