## Clean room
Controlled environment where humidity and temperature are regulated and the air has been passed through High Efficiency Particle Arrestors (HEPA filters).

## Cleaning the substrate
### RCA
Use $\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$ in acidic conditions (aqueous $\ce{HCl}$ or $\ce{NH_{3}}$) to remove metal ions or organics.

### HF
Hydrofluoric acid dip to remove oxide layer and surface contaminants.

### Fuming nitric acid
Removes organics, often used with ultrasonic agitation.

### Solvent clean
tbc

## Photoresists
Spin coating.

Adhesion promoter, drying bake

Depending on the resist, the polymer used is either weakened or generated by $\mathrm{UV}$ light:
![[photoresists.png|400]]
+ve tone resists allow finer detail than -ve.

The photon dose is important:

Photon doses below a certain level will have no effect on the resist.

+ve:

-ve:

The contrast $\gamma$ is given by
$$
\gamma= \frac{1}{\log \frac{D_{\mathrm{high}}}{D_{\mathrm{low}}}}
$$
## $\mathrm{UV}$ Photolithography

$\mathrm{UV}$ etches anything not hidden by mask. Distances characterised as
- contact printing
- proximity printing
- projection printing (uses an optical system to focus a big shadow mask on a small area)

The critical dimension of the process is the minimum feature size. Resolution limited by diffraction.

The resolution for shadow printing with thickness $z$ with contact distance $s$ is
$$
\delta=\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{ \lambda\left( s+\frac{z}{2} \right) }
$$
This is minimised by contact printing, but the force of the mask onto the sample will wear out the mask, esp. if there’s debris on the mask or sample.


In projection printing the resolution is approximated by
$$
R\propto\frac{\lambda}{N}
$$
where $N$ is the numerical aperture given by
$$
N=n\sin\theta_{\max}=\frac{D}{2F}
$$
## X-Ray Lithography

Similar to $\mathrm{UV}$ lithography. Higher resolution. X-rays not absorbed by dirt.

## $\mathrm{e}^{-}$ beam Lithography

Focus the $\mathrm{e}^{-}$ where you want them to etch. No mask needed, high resolution.

## Alignment

When patterning multiple layers, need them to be aligned. Can use a pair of reference crosses to align the layers.
