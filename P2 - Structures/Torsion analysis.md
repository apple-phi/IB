Consider a cylinder under torsion about the radial axis. The maximum shear stress is given by $$
\begin{align}
\tau_{\mathrm{max}} & = \frac{Tr}{J} \\
 & = \frac{Tr}{\left( \frac{\pi r^{4}}{2} \right)} \\
 & = \frac{2T}{\pi r^{3}}
\end{align}
$$Yield occurs first here at the maximum shear stress so this value is also the shear yield stress $k=\tau_{\mathrm{max}}$

A small element here is under pure shear, so using Mohrâ€™s circle, the equivalent state of pure stress has principle stresses $\pm k$ (and the out-of-plane stress is $0$ ).

Applying the [[Yield criteria|yield criteria]]:$$
k= \overbrace{\frac{\sigma_{y}}{2}}^{\text{Tresca}} \;\;\mathrm{or}\;\!\overbrace{\frac{\sigma_{y}}{\sqrt{ 3 }}}^{\text{von\ Mises}}
$$so an expression for the yield stress $\sigma_{y}$ can be trivially obtained. ![[pure-shear-yield-criterion.png|400]]
