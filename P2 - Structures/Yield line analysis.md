## Slabs and plates
Although an elastic analysis of slab and plate deformation is very difficult, for plastic deformation it follows by extension from the 1D case.

### Assumptions of yield line theory
- Collapse is due to *ductile flexural* failure (no contribution from shear failure etc.)
- In-plane forces negligible 
- Deformations are small compared to the overall dimensions of the structure

### Compatible yield line patterns
Some indicators of compatibility:
- Yield lines divide the slab into several rigid regions which remain planar and rotate around a unique axis
- Yield lines straight between intersections
- A yield line between two rigid regions pass through the intersection of the axis of rotation of these regions

## Angle compatibility
Given two adjoining planar regions which rotate during plastic yield by $\vec{\theta}_{1}$ and $\vec{\theta}_{2}$, the relative rotation $\vec{\theta}_{2 /1}$ is parallel to the plastic hinge between the regions, and the energy dissipated during yield by that hinge is $M\theta_{2 /1}$
