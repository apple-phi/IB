We can choose from a number of models to represent the effect of friction. The best choice would have to be determined by experiment. 
## Coulomb friction
Shear stress taken to be proportional to pressure
$$
\tau=\mu p
$$
## Tresca friction
Shear stress taken to be proportional to the shear yield stress, $k$$$
\tau=mk\quad\mathrm{s.t.}\quad k= \frac{\sigma_{y}}{2}
$$This friction coefficient is $m \in[0,1]$ depending on lubrication and is known as the sticking friction.

The value of $k$ here comes from the analysis of an element in pure shear (with principle stresses $\{\pm k, 0\}$) yielding according to the [[Yield criteria#Tresca|Tresca criterion]].
