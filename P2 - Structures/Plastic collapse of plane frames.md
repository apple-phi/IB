Portal frames have a larger number of collapse modes and can require less straight-forward techniques like the method of instantaneous centres to find the internal plastic energy dissipation.

Two common failure modes for portal frames are:
- Beam collapse
- Sway collapse
And they can also commonly present as a combined collapse mode.
## Assumptions
- No buckling
- Axial load has a negligible effect on plastic moment $M_{p}$

> The latter comes from our previous assumptions of no axial load when calculating $Zp$
## Interaction diagram
When a plane frame is subjected to two point loads $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ the the moments they induce can be normalised by the plastic moment $M_{p}$ and their relationships in different collapse modes plotted to visualise the plastic failure modes.
