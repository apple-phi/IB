Source Transmitter Channel waveform input Receiver waveform output Destination More generally, we could have multiple sources delivering information to multiple destinations through a common channel 6 / 23 Multiple Access Channel: Source Transmitter Source Transmitter Source Transmitter Channel Receiver Destination Broadcast Channel: Source Transmitter Channel Receiver Destination Receiver Destination Receiver Destination 7 / 23 For most of this course, we will focus on the point-to-point communication model: Source Transmitter Channel waveform input Receiver waveform output Destination 8 / 23 Block Diagram Components • Source of information: May be analogue (voice, music, video), or digital (e.g., e-mail, any file on your computer) • Transmitter: translates the information into a signal suitable for transmission over the channel • Channel: medium used to transmit the signal to the receiver - E.g., optical fibre, wireless channel, magnetic recording... - May distort transmitted signal, e.g., add noise or attenuate it • Receiver: reconstructs the source of information from the received signal • Destination: for whom the information is intended 9 / 23 Key Signal Properties Two properties of signals that are important for communication: 1. Power 2. Bandwidth Let us define these terms and understand why they are relevant. 10 / 23 Signal Energy The energy of a signal x(t) is defined as Ex = ∫ ∞ −∞|x(t)| 2dt If X (ω) is the Fourier transform of x(t), recall Parseval’s theorem: Ex = ∫ ∞ −∞|x(t)| 2dt = 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞|X (ω)| 2dω = ∫ ∞ −∞ |X (f )| 2df • ω = 2πf is the frequency in radians, f is frequency in Hz • |X (f )|2 is the energy spectral density Can think of |X (f )|2df as the energy of the signal in the frequency band [f , f + df ] 11 / 23 Signal Power For a signal x(t) whose energy is infinite, the power is defined as Px = lim T →∞ 1 T ∫ T /2 −T /2 |x(t)|2dt Why is signal power important? • We are usually concerned about energy of the transmitted signal per unit time, i.e., transmit power • Lower transmit power implies longer battery life for your phone • But lower transmit power also makes signal harder to detect at the receiver in the presence of noise! • Need clever Tx + Rx designs that make judicious use of available transmit power 12 / 23 Bandwidth The bandwidth of a signal is roughly the range of frequencies over which its spectrum (Fourier transform) is non-zero. −W W |X(f )| f • For real signals, bandwidth measured as the range of positive frequencies as |X (f )| is symmetric around 0 (as X (−f ) = X ∗(f ) for real x(t)) • In communications, signal bandwidth typically specified in Hz A signal is called low-pass or baseband if its spectral content is centred around f = 0. • The bandwidth of the baseband signal above is W • E.g., audio signals are baseband with bandwidth ≈ 20 kHz Voice signals in telephone systems have bandwidth ≈ 4 kHz 13 / 23 Passband signals A signal is said to be passband if its spectral content is centred around ±fc , where fc ≫ 0 −fc fc − W |X(f )| f fc + W−fc + W−fc − W fc The bandwidth of this passband signal is 2W Examples of passband signals: • AM (Amplitude-modulated) radio signals have bandwidth ≈ 10 kHz around fc ≈ 1 MHz • Transmitted signals in a WiFi network have bandwidth ≈ 20 MHz around fc ≈ 2.4 GHz 14 / 23− T 2x(t)t T 21 rect(t/T ) is the rectangular pulse, which is 1 for − T 2 ≤ t ≤ T 2 , and 0 elsewhere. What is its bandwidth? 0 15 / 23 Bandwidth – A sensible definition? Many real-world signals are time-limited ⇒ These will not be strictly limited in frequency The absolute bandwidth of rect(t/T ) is ∞. Other, more practical, definitions of bandwidth: 1. 90% bandwidth: The range of frequencies which contain 90% of the energy of the spectrum 2. 3-dB bandwidth: The range of frequencies which contain 50% of the energy of the spectrum 3. Null-to-null bandwidth: The width of the “main lobe” of the spectrum for the rect signal • The “main-lobe” bandwidth of rect(t/T ) is 1 T • If we also include one side-lobe, bandwidth of rect(t/T ) is 2 T 16 / 23 Thus, bandwidth is a measure of the extent of significant spectral content of the signal Bandwidth is a scarce resource, especially in mobile (cellular) communication: • Wireless bandwidth licensed and regulated by OFCOM • A company has to buy a slice of spectrum, say few tens of MHz around fc ≈ 2 GHz, and restrict its transmitted signals to within the spectrum • Passband 4G spectrum of few tens of MHz auctioned for hundreds of millions of £ to telecom companies! Wired channels such as telephone lines and USB cables act like linear systems or filters: • Their transfer function is roughly flat over a band of frequencies [−W , W ] around 0, and then attenuates to 0 for higher frequencies. • Therefore, transmitted signals need to be bandlimited to W In both wired and wireless communication, need good Tx + Rx designs that make optimal use of available bandwidth 17 / 23 Communication Channels What is a channel? The medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver. • Introduces attenuation and noise • So the received signal is a faded and noisy version of what the transmitter sent • Noise and attenuation can cause errors at the receiver Communications Channel Channel Input Channel Output 18 / 23 Some Real-world Channels From “Fundamentals of Wireless Communication”, Tse and Viswanath, CUP 2005 1. Mobile Wireless Channel: • There is distortion of the signal caused by multipath propagation and mobility • Exact type of distortion depends on the signal bandwidth 2. Optical Fibre Channel: • Very large BW, cheap production, low attenuation • Cons: dispersion of optical pulses, expensive regenerators reqd. • Used in the core of the internet, for long-distance communication networks 3. Electrical Wire Channel: • Twisted pair cables (e.g., Ethernet) have limited bandwidth, high attenuation; Cheap, used for short distances 19 / 23 Modelling a channel KEY Q: How to model a channel ? Channels are often modelled as linear systems with additive noise: Channel output y (t) generated from input x(t) as y (t) = h(t) ⋆ x(t) + n(t) In frequency domain: Y (f ) = H(f )X (f ) + N(f ) For example, the frequency response of a telephone cable may look like: −W W |H(f )| f 20 / 23 Additive Noise Channel If the input is restricted to the band where the channel H(f ) is flat, then the channel is Y (f ) = X (f ) + N(f ) or y (t) = x(t) + n(t) This is a very popular and useful model. What about n(t)? n(t) is thermal noise at the Rx: • Thermal noise is the noise generated by the thermal agitation of electrons inside an electrical conductor • Happens regardless of the applied voltage • All receivers (WiFi, mobile phone, AM, FM,...) generate thermal noise 21 / 23 Additive Gaussian Noise x(t) y (t) n(t) Thermal noise n(t) is modelled as a Gaussian random process: – At each time t, n(t) is a Gaussian random variable – A rigorous description requires knowledge of random processes (in 3F1) • The additive Gaussian noise channel is the workhorse of communication theory: good model for many real-world communication systems • Channels whose frequency response H(f ) is not flat are important in practice, but outside the scope of this course 22 / 23 In the remainder of the course: – we will learn how to design both analogue & digital communication schemes (Tx + Rx) – keeping in mind power and bandwidth constraints – we’ll then study how noise affects the performance of these schemes 23 / 23","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
