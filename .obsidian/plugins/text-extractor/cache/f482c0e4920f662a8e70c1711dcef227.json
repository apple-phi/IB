{"path":"P1 - Mechanics/Lecture9.pdf","text":"Lagrangian Dynamics Part IB Mechanical Engineering Lecturer: John Biggins This is a brand new course Send typos, errors and general feedback to jsb56. New handout, new examples sheets, new lab… There are no IB past tripos papers, but Extra revision questions on examples sheets Sample paper issued at the end of the course Lots of suitable tripos questions from 3C5 Lots of suitable books full of questions We all know the equation of motion is but how do we derive this? One degree of freedom, One coordinate Good, but relies on spotting a convenient coordinate system where the constraint is trivial. Also, half the work is going into finding T, which we don’t actually care about. Quick, direct, no worrying about R1, R2 We need an analogue of the energy method, that delivers equations of motion for generalized coordinates directly, without worrying about constraint forces, but which works on systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Joseph-Louis (Giuseppe Luigi), comte de Lagrange Such a method was discovered in 1788 by Lagrange. First helpful preliminary observations: Second helpful preliminary observations: 1) Choose any convenient generalized coordinates Joseph-Louis (Giuseppe Luigi), comte de Lagrange 2) Calculate total kinetic energy T and potential energy V 3) Make the Lagrangian 4) Calculate the generalized momentum and force for each generalized coordinate 5) The equation of motion for each coordinate is For the mass on a spring, we had an actual coordinate x, leading to the actual momentum, the actual force, and F=ma as the equation of motion. … It won’t always be so obvious, but the approach works for any system and with any set of generalized coordinates. Lagrangian mechanics delivered the equation of motion directly, without us spotting this trick.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
