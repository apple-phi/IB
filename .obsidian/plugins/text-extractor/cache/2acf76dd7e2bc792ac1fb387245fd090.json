Strategy Rests on Unique Activities Customer offerings should rest on capabilities, not marketing slogans Porter calls this the ‘Strategic Position’ Emerges from one or more of: • Variety-based • Scope of activities to secure efficiency • Needs-based • Value chain tailored to needs of target customers • Access-based • Geography, Scale 6 Strategic Position should… Require choice Take priority over growth—deepen not deviate Derive from auditing: • Where are we most distinctive • Where are we most profitable • Where are our customers the most satisfied • Which customers/channels/purchase occasions are the most profitable? • Which activities in the value chain are different and effective? 7 3. Sustainable Strategic Position Rests on Trade-offs If your differentiated strategy works, you will be imitated So you have to be more … Barriers include: • Brand image • Commitments • Tight co-ordination and control Avoid ‘straddling’ 8 4. Fit Drives Advantage and Sustainability No weakest link Failing to choose undermines Fit Types of Fit: • Simple consistency between activity and strategy • Reinforcing activities • Optimization of effort One way of thinking about this is to think in terms of ‘systems thinking’– the whole needs to be greater than the sum of the parts, avoid bottlenecks, seek synergies 9 From Grant, Fig 1.3– Ryanair’s Activity System 10 What is this for? 11https://libguides.babson.edu/c.php?g=26453&p=161514 What do you use it for? 12 What do you use it for? 13 Strategies (or tactics) that “mute” the force’s effect on your firm compared to others help you win Weak forces = “headroom”/opportunities to increase profits Strong forces = pain points for someone– which in turn gives rise to innovations (by you, or to be used against you…) Adjacent spaces to yours where the forces are collectively weaker might be good “moves” Adjacent spaces where the forces are stronger might be value destroying… + Addressing the Five Forces 1.
