External flow over a tube bank Natural convection for space cooling External forced convection • We can show that in all forced convection problems: 𝑁𝑢 = 𝑁𝑢(𝑅𝑒, 𝑃𝑟) (proof in next year heat transfer!) • Re number is defined on the basis of the problem configuration. • For flows inside tubes: 𝑅𝑒 = 𝑅𝑒𝐷= 𝑈𝐷 𝑣 , where D is the internal diameter of the tube. • For flow over a flat plate: 𝑅𝑒 = 𝑅𝑒𝑥 = 𝑈𝑥 𝑣 , where x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate. • Thermo-physical properties are evaluated at the average of the bulk flow temperature and the solid surface temperature (i.e. 𝑇𝑓 = (𝑇𝑠 + 𝑇∞)/2 ), film temperature. Convective heat transfer from a flat plate. Gas turbine blade cooling, the surface of the bald can be assumed flat Turbulent and laminar flows • Similar to internal flows, there is a significant difference between heat transfer characteristics of laminar and turbulent regimes in external flows. • 𝑥𝑐: the critical length for which the transition to turbulence begins. 𝑹𝒆𝒄 = 𝜌𝑢∞𝑥𝑐 𝜇 = 𝟓 × 𝟏𝟎𝟓 is the critical Reynolds number. 𝑹𝒆𝒄 is the value of 𝑅𝑒𝑥 for which transition begins, if 𝑹𝒆𝒙<𝑹𝒆𝒄 , flow is laminar. • For a laminar boundary layer over an isothermal plate: 𝑁𝑢𝑥≡ ℎ𝑥𝑥 𝑘 =0.332𝑅𝑒𝑥 1/2𝑃𝑟1/3. • For a turbulent boundary layer over an isothermal plate: 𝑁𝑢𝑥 = 0.0296𝑅𝑒𝑥 4/5𝑃𝑟1/3 where 0.6 ≤ 𝑃𝑟 ≤ 60. Boundary layer over a flat plate and transition from laminar to turbulent flow External flow over a single tube The flow field over a cylinder is quite complicated and involves: o A forward stagnation point in which the flow comes to rest. o A laminar boundary layer o Transition to turbulent boundary layer o A wake region behind the cylinder, in which flow is completely chaotic and disordered. • Precise analysis of the flow requires investigating each of these regions. • Experimental studies show that for the overall heat transfer from/to the cylinder: 𝑁𝑢𝐷 ≡ ℎ𝐷 𝑘 = 𝐶𝑅𝑒𝐷 𝑚𝑃𝑟1/3 where 𝑁𝑢 and ℎ are respectively the average Nusselt number and convective heat transfer coefficients over the cross section of the tube. Constants in heat convection correlation for the circular cylinder in cross flow Flow development in circular cylinder in cross flow External flow over banks of tubes- non-examinable Flow conditions, a) aligned, b) staggered a b • Tube bundles (banks) are commonly used in heat exchangers and thermal devices. • The flow in this problem includes all the complexities of flow over a single tube and additionally involves the effects of upstream tubes upon the downstream ones. • The average heat transfer coefficient for the entire bank can be estimated by the following correlation where 𝑁𝐿 is the number of tubes. All thermo-physical properties, with the exception of 𝑃𝑟𝑠, which is evaluated at tube surface temperature, are evaluated at the arithmetic average of the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. Values of 𝐶1 and m are listed in table below Maximum Reynolds number is defined as 𝑅𝑒𝐷,𝑚𝑎𝑥 ≡ 𝜌𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐷 𝜇 , in which 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 For aligned configuration is given by For staggered configuration 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum of the previous relation and Natural convection • From everyday life we know that hot fluid tends to rise and cold fluid always sinks. • This rise and sink of fluids with different temperatures sets convection currents (fluid motion) without any external means of pushing the fluid. • The required force for motion is supplied by buoyancy due to the difference in density of hot/cold fluid and the surrounding fluid. Numerical simulation of air motion and temperature in a room with a heater. Grashof number • Motion of fluid induced by natural convection forms a boundary layer over the solid surface. • This boundary layer is characterised by the so called Grashof number, which is defined as 𝐺𝑟𝑥 ≡ 𝑔𝛽(𝑇𝑠−𝑇∞)𝑥3 𝑣2 where 𝛽 is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient and is a thermo-physical property of the fluid (for ideal gases 𝛽 = 1 𝑇). • Grashof number is a measure of relative strength of buoyancy and viscous forces. Natural convection over a vertical isothermal, a) velocity boundary layer, b) thermal boundary layer • Re number is a measure of relative strength of inertia and viscous forces. • Gr number in natural convection is equivalent to Re number in forced convection. • Thus, in natural convection 𝑁𝑢 = 𝑁𝑢 𝐺𝑟, 𝑃𝑟 . Natural Convection-Empirical Correlations • In engineering, we often use empirical correlations to obtain an estimation of natural convection coefficient. • The product of Gr and Pr is termed Rayleigh number, which appears frequently in natural convection correlations 𝑅𝑎𝑥 ≡ 𝐺𝑟𝑥𝑃𝑟 = 𝑔𝛽(𝑇𝑠−𝑇∞)𝑥3 𝑣𝛼 . • For free convection from a vertical plate, the average Nusselt number over the plate is given by 𝑁𝑢𝐿 = 0.825 + 0.387 𝑅𝑎𝐿 1/6 1+(0.492/𝑃𝑟)9/16 8/27 2 • Similar correlations exist for other configurations, e.g. flow over or under a flat plate. • Similar to external flow the thermo-physical properties are evaluated at the average temperature of stagnant fluid and surface temperature (film temperature).
