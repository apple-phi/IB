Introduction In 1987, Cray Research Inc. released the Cray-2, then the world’s fastest computer at 250MHz with 2Gb of RAM. It was contained in a cylindrical cabinet 1.15m high and 1.35m in diameter. “We solved the problem of dissipating the 130kW it produced by immersing all the circuitry in a bath of inert liquid ﬂuorocarbon. Computer designers are gloriﬁed cooling engineers and I am a very good plumber. “ Seymour Cray We have already used a convective boundary condition The heat transfer coefficient, h, is defined by: 𝑞̇ = − ℎ ∆𝑇 h may vary with position, e.g. x, (see later). Often we will use the averaged heat transfer coefficient, 𝑄 𝐴 ̇ = − ℎ𝑎𝑣∆𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  h and hav tend to get used interchangeably, depending upon the problem.  Often, we will want the average heat transfer coefficient, and the fluid mechanics will be too complicated to allow us to calculate the local value. We need to be able to estimate the values of h. There are two distinct situations we need to consider; 1. Forced convection- when the fluid is driven over the surface by e.g. a fan or pump. 2. Free (natural) convection – when density differences due to buoyancy drive the flow. Forced convection is almost always the quickest way to transfer heat. In both situations, we must consider the flow of fluid over the surface.

Heat transfer and fluid mechanics The thermal (temperature) field of a flow cannot affect the mechanical (pressure and velocity) fields if the density is assumed to be constant. We can calculate the mechanical fields first and then calculate their effect on the temperature field. The mechanical fields, however, always affect the thermal field, both by viscous dissipation and simply by convecting hot fluid through space (i.e. forced convection). If the density cannot be assumed to be constant, the calculation requires feedback from the thermal to the mechanical ﬁeld and is more complicated. From the equation of state of ideal gases1, ρ = P/RT , we see that dρ/ρ = −dT/T . Incompressibility can be assumed when temperature fluctuations are less than approximately 0.1 of the background temperature. Incompressibility also requires that the Mach number is less than around 0.3. 𝑀 < 0.3 ⟹ 𝑐𝑝𝑇 ≫ 𝑣 2/2 i.e the enthalpy of the fluid per unit mass, 𝑐𝑝𝑇, is much greater than the kinetic energy per unit mass 𝑣 2/2. The convective energy transfer is then just 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝𝑇, and the steady flow energy equation becomes 𝑄̇ − 𝑊𝑥̇ = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (𝑐𝑝𝑇 + 1 2 𝑣 2 + 𝑔𝑧)𝑖𝑛 − 𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑐𝑝𝑇 + 1 2 𝑣 2 + 𝑔𝑧)𝑜𝑢𝑡 The properties of the fluid, such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, depend on temperature. Although this does not provide a mechanism for energy to pass from the thermal to the mechanical field, it does allow the thermal field slightly to affect the mechanical field. If temperature differences are small, the variations in these properties are small. Very often the properties are assumed to take the values at the mean value of the temperature, the film temperature. 1 In other fluids, with other equations of state, we must be careful not to be near a region of sudden density change such as the boiling point.

The analogy between heat and momentum transfer In earlier lectures you looked at the diffusion of ordered momentum between two fluid layers due to molecular motion.

Non-dimensional heat transfer coefficients In many situations, the fluid mechanics will be too complicated to allow the heat transfer coefficient to be computed directly. We will have to resort to dimensional analysis and correlations. Nusselt Number (commonly used) The Nusselt Number is found by normalising the heat flux, but a conductive heat flux.

Reynolds’ analogy (Prandtl number = 1) If the Prandtl number equals 1, the momentum diffusivity equals the thermal diffusivity. This means that the non-dimensional equations of heat and momentum transfer are identical. In some situations, the non-dimensional boundary conditions are also identical. This means that the non-dimensional solutions are identical and therefore that there is a direct relationship between the mechanical and thermal fields. This is Reynolds’ analogy. To demonstrate this, we will revisit the flow over a flat plate. 4.5.1. Recap of the momentum boundary layer over a flat plate The velocity profile for the laminar boundary layer was given (approximately) by 𝑣𝑥(𝑦) 𝑉 = 3 2 𝑦 𝛿 − 1 2 (𝑦 𝛿) 3 We also saw that the thickness of the boundary layer grows with distance from the leading edge as 𝛿 𝑥 = 4.64 √𝑅𝑒𝑥 4.5.2.

This is not surprising because both heat and momentum transfer have the same underlying mechanism: molecular motion or, in a turbulent flow, eddy motion 1B Heat Transfer last edited sas37/2018 10 4.6. Heat transfer if the Prandtl number ≠1 If the Prandtl number is not equal to 1, the transport equations are no longer identical and we have two types of boundary layer: a momentum boundary layer and a thermal boundary layer. The relative thicknesses of the boundary layers are determined by the Prandtl number We find from experiments that: 3 2 Pr 2 1   f p cSt Vc h  (For gases usually have Pr  0.7 the correction is small and usually ignored). 4.7.

Suitable averages would have to be taken to give the average heat transfer coefficient over a plate of length L. The databook gives correlations for the averaged/overall Nusselt number, for various geometries, from which the overall heat transfer coefficient can be derived. 1B Heat Transfer last edited sas37/2018 12 4.9. The forced convection experiment In most situations, the flow field is too complicated to be calculated by hand. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used but this is often expensive and may not be accurate. It can be easier to perform an experiment on a geometrically-identical situation and then scale up with the relevant non- dimensional parameters. You do this in the 1B heat transfer experiment of forced convection over a platinum wire. 1. List the dependent and independent variables Dependent Independent 2. Count the dimensions 3. Create dimensionless numbers When you plot the Nusselt number as a function of Reynolds number (given that air has a fixed Prandtl number) you find that your results collapse to a single line. 1B Heat Transfer last edited sas37/2018 13 The physics is encapsulated in this line. For a gas with the same Prandtl number as air, you can use the chart you created to calculated the heat transfer from a geometrically similar situation of any size, between the Reynolds number ranges that you studied. In heat transfer problems you usually have to rely on dimensional analysis and scaling. 4.10. Key Points for Forced Convection  Heat transfer takes place in boundary layers and is strongly influenced by the state, size, etc. of the local boundary layer.  There is a strong analogy between heat transfer and momentum transfer leading to Reynolds Analogy f p cSt Vc h 2 1    The local heat transfer coefficient for a flat plate can be derived from a simple model of the velocity profile  Turbulent boundary layers involve higher heat transfer than laminar ones.  Correlations (i.e. curve fits to experimental data) will be different for different states of boundary layers (laminar, transitional, turbulent) and it is important to check.  For more general problems  PrRe,fn λDh Nu av av ","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
