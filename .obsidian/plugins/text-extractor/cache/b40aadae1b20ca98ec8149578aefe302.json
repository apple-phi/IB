You have a ping-pong ball, a cricket ball and a ten-pin bowling ball. Your friend has a football, a billiard ball and an ice hockey puck (on its side). You line up at the top of the slope and let them roll to the bottom. You want to ﬁgure out which ones get to the bottom fastest. (a) Find an expression relating the speed v and the angular velocity ω for a ball of radius a rolling with no slip. (b) Use the change in kinetic energy to ﬁnd the angular velocity of a ball when it has de- scended a vertical height h. Express your answer in terms of k, the radius of gyration of the ball as given in the Mechanics Data Book. (c) Look up the radius of gyration of each of the objects and deduce their order of arrival. (d) What is the ﬁnal velocity of a hollow cylinder descending h on a slope whose angle to the horizontal is θ where tan θ = 0.1 (assume small angles), and how long does this journey take? (e) Where might you expect an empty, a full and a frozen can of soft drink to appear in this race? Do the experiment! w v h q Figure 1 A B Figure 2 2 A thin uniform hoop of mass m and radius a is supported in a vertical plane by two pegs A and B at the same level, a√ 2 apart as shown in Figure 2. Peg B is removed and the hoop begins to fall, with no slip at peg A. (a) Find the moment of inertia of the hoop about A and the initial angular acceleration of the hoop. (b) Use the d’Alembert force at the hoop centre to deter- mine the normal and tangential components of the reaction at A and hence show that there will be no initial slip if the coefﬁcient of friction exceeds 0.5. IB/P1/1 1 HEMH/JSB / 2023 3 A pencil, modelled as a uniform rod of length 2a, is standing at rest on the edge of a table as shown in Figure 3(a). An impulse I delivered to the bottom of the pencil causes it to ﬂy through the air. The impulse is just hard enough so that the tip P of the pencil hits the edge of the table. (a) After the impulse the centre of mass of the pencil moves with horizontal velocity v and its angular velocity is ω as shown in Figure 3(b). Find an expression for v in terms of ω. (b) Find the angle θ of the pencil when it just hits the table, as shown in Figure 3(c). See if you can measure this angle using your phone camera.

A particle P of mass m can move on the rod and the distance OP is x, but to begin with the particle is stuck on the rod at x = L. At time t = 0 the particle becomes unstuck and then slides freely towards A. (a) Using the rotating unit vectors er and eθ, and coordinate x as shown ﬁnd vector expres- sions for the position, velocity and acceleration of the particle for t > 0. (b) Find a differential equation in x. (c) Solve for x and determine the time at which the particle leaves the rod. (d) At the instant just before the particle leaves the rod use d’Alembert principle to deter- mine the force acting on the rod and ﬁnd the torque at O required to drive the rod at this instant.

At the instant shown the driving link OB is rotating slowly at a constant angular velocity ω so as to lift a weight mg which is hang- ing from point C. A point X on the rod is instantaneously adjacent to the slider at B. (a) Locate the instantaneous centre of the slider. (To do this, imagine an extension of the slider and ﬁnd the direction of the velocity of that part of the extension that is instantaneously over point A). (b) Use the method of instantaneous centres to ﬁnd the angular velocity of rod AC, the vertical component of the velocity of point C and the sliding velocity at B (ie the relative velocity between B and X). (c) Sketch a velocity diagram showing the velocities of points A, B, X and C. Check that the distances between A,X and C are consistent with the Velocity Image theo- rem. (d) Find the torque T needed at O to lift the weight mg. (e) A friction force F acts at between the rod and the slider at B and a friction torque Q acts at the pin at B. What is the additional torque required at O to overcome the effects of friction?

The distance between the ends A and B of the ram is x. At a certain instant when x = 1m the ends A and B are each moving at constant velocity and so have zero acceleration. The ram is extending so that ˙x = 1 ms−1 and the rate of oil ﬂow is increasing at a rate corresponding to ¨x = 1 ms −2.
