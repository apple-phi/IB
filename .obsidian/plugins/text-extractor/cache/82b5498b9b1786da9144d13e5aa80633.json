An 11 kV three-phase power line feeds two isolated factories, which are effectively connected in parallel with each other. The first factory load is star- connected, and it draws 6 MW at a power factor of 0.8 leading. The second factory is delta-connected and it draws 8 MW at a power factor of 0.6 lagging. Calculate the supply line current and power factor. Determine also the phase voltage and current for the two factory loads. 5. A town takes a load of 60 MW at a power factor of 0.85 lagging as a balanced load from a three-phase power line. The line-line voltage at the town is 132 kV. The feeder has an impedance of 10 + j55  per line. Find the line current, and calculate the line voltage at the sending end of the feeder. What would be the reduction in power loss in the feeder if the power factor of the load were improved to unity while the load voltage remained at 132 kV, and what would the sending-end line voltage then be ? * 6. A 415 V, 50 Hz, 3-phase supply feeds a star-connected load consisting of three impedances of (10 + j10) ohms, and a delta-connected load consisting of three impedances of (30 + j10) ohms.
