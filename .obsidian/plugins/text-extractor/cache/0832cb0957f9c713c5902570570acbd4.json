Complete the notebook, making sure you fulﬁll the following tasks: (a) Make plots showing your best ﬁt between simulation and Experiments 1 and 4. (b) Conduct a simulation with initial condition (α, β, ˙α, ˙β) = (α0, 0, 0, 0) with α0 = 10◦. Compare this motion with motion starting from α0 + ∆α for ∆α = 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 ◦.... (c) Repeat the above exercise but with α0 = 90◦, and make a plot of divergence time vs ∆α. Can we ever make long term predictions for this system? (d) Create Poincare sections for simulations with a range of initial conditions, including examples which are periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic. Bring plots summarizing your results for each task to your supervision.

Time varying Lagrangians 7 † A pendulum consists of a mass m on a light rod l. The pendulum is mounted in an elevator, which is accelerating upwards at a.

An addi- tional horizontal force F = F0 cos(ωt) is applied to the left hand mass. (a) Write down the Lagrangian for the system, including the driving force. (b) Find the equations of motion of the system, and write them in matrix form. (c) Find the steady-state response of the system (the particular integral) and sketch the amplitude of the responses of x1 and x2 as a function of ω. IB/P1/4 4 JSB/HEMH / February 2023 9 * A simple model of a child on a swing is sketched below. The swing is modeled as a light rod, of length l, which makes an angle θ with the vertical. The child is modeled as two point masses m on either end of a light rod of length 2a. The rod is attached at its center to the end of the swing, and makes an angle ϕ with the swing rod. The angle ϕ(t) is not a dynamical degree of freedom, but rather controlled by the child in order to keep the swing moving. m m (a) Find the system’s Lagrangian and show that the equation of motion for θ is: (l2 + a2)¨θ + a2 ¨ϕ = −gl sin θ. (b) The child pumps the swing by alternating between a laying ﬂat and sitting upright, giving ϕ = ϕ0+b sin(ωt). What value of ω should the child select to swing the most effectively? (c) A second strategy for swinging involves standing on the swing and alternating between crouching down and standing upright. In this case we have a parametric oscillator, with the length of the pendulum being changed as a function of time. Given this is a parametric oscillator, what frequency of crouching and standing should the child select to swing the most effectively?
