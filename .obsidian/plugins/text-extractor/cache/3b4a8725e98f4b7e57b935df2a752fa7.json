This is the parameter we are trying to image with OCT. I is the round trip distance from the laser pulse source, (o the reference mirror, and back to the photo-detector. 15 is the round trip distance from the laser pulse source, to a scatterer at a particular depth, and back to the photo-detector. c is the average speed of light in the medium being imaged and the medium in the interferometer.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
