The blade is freely pivoted at A to a rigid hub of radius R which is spinning about O at a constant angular velocity Ω as shown . The angle OAB is θ. (a) In the context of this application why is reasonable to ignore the effects of gravity? (b) Using the rotating unit vectors e1 and e2 as shown ﬁnd a vector expression for the acceleration of the centre of mass of the blade. (c) Find a differential equation for θ and the frequency ω of small vibration of the blade. (d) If the small-amplitude motion of the blade is θ = θ0 sin ωt ﬁnd an expression for the reaction force at A using unit vectors e2 and e ∗ 2. 2aW O A R B qe1 e1* Figure 1 IB/P1/2 1 HEMH/JSB / February 2022 2 A mechanism is shown in plan in Figure 2. AB is a uniform rigid rod of length l and mass m hinged at a ﬁxed pivot A. A similar uniform rigid rod CD of length l and mass m is hinged at its midpoint to the rod AB at B. The motion of CD is constrained by a light tie-rod CE, also of length l, ﬁxed to a point E located so that ABE is 90 ◦. The mechanism is initially at rest in the position shown with CD parallel to AB and the angle DEC equal to 60 ◦. The distance between AB and CD is negligible. A torque T is applied to AB to give it an angular acceleration α. The effect of gravity can be ignored. (a) Sketch an acceleration diagram and hence ﬁnd the initial linear acceleration of point B and initial angular acceleration of CD. (b) Determine the value of T and the corresponding force in CE. l E a A B DC l l Figure 2 Bending moments and shear forces in mechanisms T P l A Ax Figure 3 3 A uniform bar of mass m per unit length and of length l is pivoted about a ﬁxed vertical axis at one end P as shown in Figure 3.

The centre of one of its wheels traces a path of radius R centred on O moving with a uniform speed v as shown in Figure 7. The centre of the wheel is labelled Q and the point on the tyre instantaneously in contact with the ground is labelled P. A unit vector e1 is aligned with OQ and a unit vector e2 is aligned with QP. The unit vectors i, j and k are a ﬁxed reference frame where k is the upward vertical and e1 is instantaneously aligned with i. (a) Express the angular velocity vectors ω1 and ω2 of the car and wheel respectively in terms of v, R and r using the unit vectors given. (b) Write down an expression for the position vector of P using e1 and e2 and hence ﬁnd vector expressions for (i) the velocity and (ii) the acceleration of point P (do not expand cross products). (c) Evaluate the instantaneous velocity and acceleration of P in the ﬁxed i, j, k reference frame. (d) Sketch the paths traced out by Q and by P as the wheel rolls along its curved path. Hence account on geometric grounds for the outward direction of the acceleration of point P.
