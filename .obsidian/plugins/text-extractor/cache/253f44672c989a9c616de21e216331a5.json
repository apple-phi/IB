Heat Transfer by Radiation Heat can be transferred by Electromagnetic waves emitted by a body as a result of its temperature. It does not require a medium between the bodies (e.g. sun to earth), and can occur through a medium which is colder than either body. Figure 1. Electromagnetic Spectrum, source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum Thermal radiation lies approximately in the wavelength range 0.1μm to 100 μm (3.1015 to 3.1012 Hz), visible light is in the range 0.35 μm to 0.75 μm. 6.1. The black body A “black body” is an idealised object, which will 1. completely absorb all radiation incident upon it. 2. emit the largest amount of energy per unit area possible for a given temperature The maximum rate at which a body can radiate energy is given by the Stefan- Boltzmann Law1 𝐸𝑏 = 𝜎𝑇4 where σ (= 5.67x10-8 Wm-2K-4) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and Eb is called the black body emissive power. 1 The Stefan-Boltzmann Law can be derived from statistical mechanics, which is beyond the scope of this course. 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 2 The monochromatic emissive power of a black body2 (i.e. the power emitted between wavelengths  and +d) is given by the relationship 1 2 5 1    Tcb e c E   where λ is the wavelength, c1 = 3.743x108 Wμm/m2, and c2 = 1.4387x104 μmK. If one integrates this expression over all wavelengths we obtain 𝐸𝑏 = ∫ 𝐸𝑏𝜆𝑑𝜆 ∞ 0 = 𝜎𝑇4 The figure below shows plots from the equation for bE for a range of temperatures. Figure 2. Spectrum of radiation from a black body Note that the peak moves to shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature – the visible spectrum is between 0.4 μm (violet) and 0.7μm (red), so we would expect a body being heated to appear dull red first, then a colour change through orange to yellow etc. The peak value of bE is at a wavelength m T  6.2897 max  How hot is the surface of the sun? The sun’s surface behaves almost as a black body, with a temperature of about 5780K – from the relationship above 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 2897.6 5780 = 0.5 𝜇𝑚 -not surprisingly, in the visible range. 2 This is a result from statistical thermodynamics and its derivation is beyond the scope of this course. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 0 5 10 15d(Q/A)/d(kWm-2 m-1) Wavelength (m) 600 K 800 K 1000 K 1200 K 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 3 6.2. Real surfaces Real surfaces emit less radiation than a black body. The monochromatic emissivity  characterises the surface 𝜀𝜆 = radiation emmited per unit area between λ and λ+dλ 𝐸𝑏𝜆 The monochromatic emissivity is a function of the wavelength of radiation, . The total emissivity (usually just called the emissivity) is given by In general the emissivity is a function of temperature.

Absorption, transmission and reflection When radiation strikes a surface, a fraction (= ρ, the reflectivity) will be reflected, a fraction (= α, the absorbtivity) will be absorbed, and a fraction (= τ, the transmissivity) will be transmitted. Thus 1  . Most solid bodies do not transmit thermal radiation, so the transmissivity can be taken as zero, hence 1 . The reflected part of the radiation may be “specular” (i.e. as from a mirror), diffuse (i.e. scattered equally in all directions), or some combination of these. Most surfaces are predominately diffuse reflectors. 6.2.3. Kirchhoff’s identity Due to processes occurring at the quantum scale (very very small!), the probability of a photon being absorbed on hitting the surface, is equal to the probability of a photon being emitted. This gives rise to Kirchhoff’s identity. Kirchhoff’s identity, 𝜺 = 𝜶, i.e. the absorptivity is equal to the emissivity. There is a question on the example sheet which “proves” this must be true for a body exchanging radiation with black enclosure, at equilibrium. However, Kirchhoff’s identity is generally true. 6.2.4. Radiation to and from a non -black bodies. The total radiative emission from a non-black body surface not only has an 𝜀𝐸𝑏 component (the radiation leaving a surface due to its temperature), but also a  times the incident radiation’ component. Let us define two new terms: G = Irradiation. The total radiation incident on a surface per unit time and area J = Radiosity. The total radiation leaving a surface per unit time and area. We further assume that these quantities are uniform over each surface: this needs to be kept in mind when applying the results to come.

Since   11 (the surfaces are assumed to be non-transmissive), the expression for J may be written 𝐽 = 𝜀𝐸𝑏 + (1 − 𝜀)𝐺 𝐺 = 𝐽 − 𝜀𝐸𝑏 1 − 𝜀 Now the net radiation leaving a surface per unit area per unit time  AQ / is the difference between the radiosity and the irradiation, so 𝑄̇ 𝐴 = 𝐽 − 𝐺 = 𝜀𝐸𝑏 + (1 − 𝜀)𝐺 − 𝐺 If we substitute for G, we obtain   A JE Q b    1  . The expression above can be interpreted using an “ohm’s law” analogy, with 𝐸𝑏 − 𝐽 as a potential difference, and 1−𝜀 𝜀𝐴 as a ‘surface’ resistance. i.e. G ρG εEb GEJ b   1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 6 A1 A2 𝐽2𝐴2𝐹21 𝐽1𝐴1𝐹12 𝐽1 𝑅 = 1 A1F12 𝐽2 6.3. Radiative exchange between surfaces Let us examine the heat transfer between two surfaces 1A and 2A (both diffuse reflectors) We define 12F as the fraction of energy leaving surface 1 that arrives at surface 2 21F as the fraction of energy leaving surface 2 that arrives at surface 1  Fi,j is called the shape factor (or sometimes the view factor)  Fi,j is purely geometric and is related to how much of surface j can be seen by surface i Since electromagnetic rays travel in straight lines, if radiation can travel from 1 to 2 along a path, it can also travel from 2 to 1 along the same path. This means that view factors are linked by the reciprocity relationship. 212121 FAFA  sinceit is purely geometric this does not depend the nature of the radiation emitted or reflected from the surface. Of the total radiation that leaves surface 1 ( 11 AJ ), a quantity 1211 FAJ reaches surface 2. Likewise from 2 to 1, a quantity 2122 FAJ reaches surface 2 from surface 1. The net exchange is thus given by 2122121112 FAJFAJQ  But 212121 FAFA  , so 121 21 12 1 FA JJ Q   We interpret this expression in an “Ohm’s Law” way, regarding 12Q as a current flow, 21 JJ  as a potential difference, and 121 1 FA as a ‘space’ resistance. The determination of shape factors for other than the simplest geometries is tedious and normally done by computer or taken from graphical data. However we shall now see, certain useful results can be deduced by physical reasoning. 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 7 6.3.1. Shape factor algebra Consider the radiation exchange situation shown in the figure – the L- section is extends infinitely into the page, and for simplicity, let us assume surfaces 1 and 2 are of equal length in the plane of the page. Typically we will be interested in the radiation exchange between the three surfaces, 3 representing the environment. Ignore for the moment the dashed line (surface 4). Shape factors for a surface add up to unity By definition, the shape factor is the fraction of energy leaving one surface and hitting another, therefore 1131211  FFF Note that we have included the self shape factor, F11, since a surface may be able to see itself. Convex surfaces cannot see themselves – self view factor = 0 In the above figure, surface 1 cannot see itself, so F11 = 0. Reciprocity As demonstrated above, for example, F12A1 = F21A2, where A1=A2 in this example. Using these rules (and simple logic), we can for example, calculate F12. By drawing the imaginary surface 4, we note that 11214  FF , so if we can find 14F the problem is solved. By reciprocity: 𝐴1𝐹14 = 𝐴4𝐹41 And by symmetry 𝐹41 = 0.5 𝐹14 = 0.5 𝐴4 𝐴1 ⟹ 𝐹14 = √2 2 𝐹12 = 1 − 𝐹14 = 1 − √2 2 = .293 Note that this relationship applies to black and non-black bodies, but the radiation must be diffuse. 3 4 2 1 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 8 2 6.3.2. Example – radiation exchange between concentric cylinders. The radiation network is Thus, the overall “resistance” is 1 − 𝜀1 𝜀1𝐴1 + 1 A1F12 + 1 − 𝜀2 𝜀2𝐴2 So that the heat exchanged between 1 and 2 is, 𝑄̇ = (𝜎𝑇1 4 − 𝜎𝑇2 4) ( 1 − 𝜀1 𝜀1𝐴1 + 1 A1F12 + 1 − 𝜀2 𝜀2𝐴2 ) Since 112 F , and multiplying top and bottom by A1, 𝑄̇ = 𝐴1(𝜎𝑇1 4 − 𝜎𝑇2 4) ( 1 − 𝜀1 𝜀1 + 1 + (A1 A2) (1 − 𝜀2) 𝜀2 ) Note that this expression is valid whether the cylinders are concentric or not; in fact either cylinder can be any shape as long as 011 F - i.e. the inner cylinder cannot see itself. A very useful result is obtained when 2A (or 12  ), which is that 𝑄̇ = 𝐴1𝜀1(𝜎𝑇1 4 − 𝜎𝑇2 4) This expression is quite general – it says (in words) that when an object is in a large enclosure, the net radiation exchange is independent of the emissivity of the enclosure, and it is as if the enclosure were a black body. A couple of lines of manipulation of the relationships above shows that 21 bEG  for 12 AA  , i.e. all the radiation striking surface 1, appears as if it has come from a black body.

Radiation in the environment Solar radiation is very different to most terrestrial radiation, in that it is at much shorter wavelengths, and many important phenomena that affect us directly relate to this.

Example- a simple model of the greenhouse effect A very simple model of the green house gas effect shows how the wave length difference between solar and terrestrial radiation is central. Previously we assumed that the absorbance, reflectivity and emissivity were not functions of wavelength, when considering the greenhouse effect, this approximation is no longer valid. Albedo, A = the fraction of the incident (i.e. short wave) radiation which is reflected First consider a planet, radius R, with a solar flux (short wave radiation) of S Wm-2, and an albedo of A. For long wave radiation, the planet can be taken to be black. The overall energy (short wave) absorbed is projected area×S × fraction absorbed, i.e.  ARSQs  1 2 If the planet’s surface is at eT , then the (mainly long wave) energy emitted is 424 ep TRQ  . At steady state 𝑄̇ 𝑠 = 𝑄̇ 𝑝 giving 𝜎𝑇𝑒 4 = 𝑆(1 − 𝐴) 4 For S = 1000 Wm-2, and average value of the albedo, A = 0.1, we get Te = 250 K, too cold to support life on earth! We have neglected fact that the Earth's atmosphere contains gases that absorb the longwave radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. S F = 𝜎𝑇𝑒 4 Sun Earth at temperature Te 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 13 Consider the (simplified) situation shown below, where we have (very crudely) assumed that infra-red absorbing gases form a layer of some thickness above the surface, spread equally over the entire planet. The overall energy (short wave) absorbed is projected area×S × fraction absorbed, i.e.  ARSQs  1 2 The gas layer absorbs F, and itself emits a radiative (infra-red) flux of H. Since the layer is elevated from the surface, it emits radiation through both its upper and lower surface in equal amounts. Thus overall the layer emits a total flux of 2H W m-2. In this new situation the outer surface of the absorbing layer becomes the outer surface of the planet, so that the amount of energy radiated by the planet becomes, HRQ p 24 . At steady sate 𝑄̇ 𝑠 = 𝑄̇ 𝑝 giving   4 1 SA H   (*) At the surface, the energy balance is: 4𝜋𝑅2𝐹 = 𝐻 4𝜋𝑅2 + (1 − 𝐴)𝑆𝜋𝑅2 i.e. 𝐹 = 𝐻 + (1−𝐴)𝑆 4 Using this result to eliminate H from (*) gives:   2 14 SA TF e   The addition of one IR absorbing layer has thus changed the balance of energy at the ground. Using the same values of S (=1000 Wm-2) and A (=0.1) as before, we now get Te = 298.5 K. Without the greenhouse effect, life on earth would not exist!
