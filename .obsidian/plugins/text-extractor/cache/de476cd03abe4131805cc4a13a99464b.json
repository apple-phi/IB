Elastic structural analysis: symmetry and anti-symmetry 1.† Split the loading on the beam shown in Figure 1 into symmetric and anti-symmetric components and, hence, calculate the deﬂection of the centre of the beam due to the applied load. The beam has ﬂexural rigidity EI. l l w/unit length A B Figure 1 2. In the plane portal frame shown in Figure 2, all the joints are rigid and the ﬂexural rigidity, EI, is uniform; the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion is α. Setting the horizontal forces and bending moments at both feet to be redundant, but equal and opposite (why?), ﬁnd the horizontal reaction and the bending moment induced at the column feet by a uniform temperature rise, T . l l Figure 2 2/4 CUED 2023-24 - 2- 3.∗ The ring structure in Figure 3 is fully ﬁxed to its foundation and is initially stress-free. It has a uniform bending stiﬀness, EI. An in-plane vertical load, W , is applied at B, as shown. (a) Sketch the ring and show all the forces acting upon it, including the reactions. Making use of symmetry and equilibrium, write all of the reactions in terms of H, the horizontal reaction at A, and the applied load, W . (b) By enforcing compatibility, calculate the value of H. (c) Calculate the horizontal and vertical deﬂection of B.

For section (b), compare your value with the corresponding section in the Structures Data book, p. 24; why is there a diﬀerence?

Two point loads are applied, simultaneously, as shown.

The beam carries a load, 6W , uniformly distributed over the span, AB, together with a point load, W , at the tip, C. (a) Find the value of W at collapse based on an assumed collapse mechanism involv- ing a single plastic hinge occurring at B. (b) Consider an alternative collapse mechanism with a single hinge in the span, AB, occurring at an arbitrary distance, x, from A. Find the corresponding collapse load, W , in terms of x; hence, ﬁnd the minimum value of the collapse load for this mechanism, and the corresponding value of x.

Find the value of the load, W , for plastic collapse to occur, given that the fully plastic moment is Mp. The support at C provides total restraint to vertical movement: is this a relevant consideration? Does the length of the span, BC, aﬀect the limiting value of W ?

The beam carries a total load of magnitude, 5W/4, uniformly distributed over the length, AC. (a) Consider, initially, only collapse mechanisms that have a plastic hinge at one or more of the points; A, B, mid-span of AB. Find a good upper bound on the value of W at collapse. (b) Make an improved upper bound estimate by allowing the position of the hinge near the mid-span to vary. What is the percentage change in the estimate from (a)?

The light portal frame shown in Figure 9 has full strength joints and ﬁxed feet. the fully plastic moment, Mp, is 60 kNm for the beam and 40 kNm for each column. The frame is to carry working loads as shown. Determine the load factor, λ, that, when applied to both loads together, will cause the frame to collapse plastically.
