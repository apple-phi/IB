7 1.6 The continuum approach. Fields and partial derivatives In the molecular description of a ﬂuid, every molecule has a velocity vector, vi, and obeys Newton’s laws of motion. The velocity is held by the molecule so we use ordinary derivatives such as d/dt. If we knew exactly how all the molecules started we could march forwards in time solving ordinary diﬀerential equations for each molecule. However, this is impractical for more than a few million molecules. • vi held by each molecule • Fi = m × ai = • Once we average over the very many molecules that occupy even a tiny region of space, we obtain a macroscopic, continuum picture of the ﬂow. We can then think of ﬂow variables, such as the velocity, deﬁned at points in space, rather than for each discrete molecule. Instead of velocities assigned to each molecule, we now have a velocity ﬁeld distributed in space. The description of the motion is no longer given by ordinary derivatives in time alone, as the velocity varies not only in time but also from one point to another. We therefore need to use partial derivatives, including the partial derivative with respect to time ∂/∂t, but also the spatial deriva- tives (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z). In this scenario, Newton’s laws of motion still hold, but they adopt a slightly diﬀerent form, as we will see in the coming lectures. In sum, by averaging over very many molecules and very many collisions, we exchange an enormous number of relatively simple ordinary diﬀerential equations for a few (but somewhat more complicated) partial diﬀerential equations, which describe the ﬂow in terms of ﬁelds. • v deﬁned at points in space, • the average velocity in the top box is • the average velocity in the bottom box is • This is a crucial -but not at all straightforward- conceptual leap, and it took centuries for physicists and engineers to make it. In the words of Albert Einstein, “the application of Newton’s mechanics to continuously distributed masses led in- evitably to the discovery and application of partial diﬀerential equations, which in their turn ﬁrst provided the language for the laws of the ﬁeld-theory.” 8 1.7 The del operator As we have just discussed, when dealing with point masses, we use ordinary diﬀer- ential operators, such as d/dt, while when dealing with ﬁelds we need to use partial diﬀerential operators, such as ∂/∂t, ∂/∂x, ∂/∂y and ∂/∂z. In space, partial diﬀer- ential operators are not very useful independently; they only give the change in one direction and, even worse, that direction depends on the choice of coordinate system. The real power of these partial diﬀerential operators arises when they are com- bined to form the del operator, which is given the symbol ∇ and is also called nabla. ∇ alone holds the full sense of spatial derivative, and it is invariant with respect to the coordinate system we choose. In Cartesian coordinates, the form of ∇ is very simple: ∇ ≡ ˆex ∂ ∂x + ˆey ∂ ∂y + ˆez ∂ ∂z = However, the fact that ∇ is independent of the coordinate system can make its expression in other coordinates very diﬀerent. For instance, in cylindrical polars it is: ∇ ≡ ˆer ∂ ∂r + ˆeθ 1 r ∂ ∂θ + ˆez ∂ ∂z 9 Furthermore, in a Cartesian coordinate system, the unit vectors are the same everywhere. This means that, when ∇ acts on a vector, we do not need to worry about the eﬀect of ∇ on the unit vectors, because ∂ˆex/∂x, ∂ˆey/∂x etc. are all zero. This is why the Cartesian shorthand works for ∇. ˆex ˆey (x1, y1) ˆex ˆey (x2, y2) ˆex, ˆey do not vary in space In other coordinate systems, the unit vectors are not the same everywhere. This means that, when ∇ acts on a vector, its eﬀect on the unit vectors must also be taken into account. We will encounter this in the worked example in Lecture 2 (sec- tion 2.5) and in Lecture 3 when diﬀerentiating along and across streamlines (section 3.5), and you can also ﬁnd an example on the website. ˆer ˆeθ ˆer ˆeθ ˆer, ˆeθ { • do not vary with r • vary with θ 10 Engineering Tripos 1B Paper 4 Fluid Mechanics Lecture 2 - Vector calculus in ﬂuid mechanics ‹ The gradient of a scalar ﬁeld ‹ The divergence of a vector ﬁeld - Conservation of mass - Incompressible ﬂow ‹ The curl of a vector ﬁeld - Vorticity ‹ Changes due to motion through a ﬁeld - Advection Ricardo Garcia-Mayoral r.gmayoral@eng.cam.ac.uk 1 2.1 The gradient of a scalar ﬁeld In Lecture 1, we have seen how ∇ encompasses all the spatial derivatives in a single vector-like, diﬀerential operator. When ∇ acts directly on a scalar ﬁeld, it produces a vector that points in the direction of steepest increase of that scalar. Its magnitude equals the gradient in that direction. For example this weather map shows lines of constant pressure above the USA. ∇p is known as “grad p” because it gives the gradient of p at all points in the ﬁeld. ∇p =   ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z   p = The vector ∇p is orthogonal to the contour lines and points in the direction in which the pressure increases. Its module |∇p| is equal to the magnitude of the slope along ∇p. 2 2.2 The divergence of a vector ﬁeld The del operator ∇ can be applied on a vector ﬁeld a through a dot product, ∇ · a. This is known as the divergence of the vector ﬁeld a. If we apply the divergence to the velocity ﬁeld in Cartesian coordinates, the resulting scalar ﬁeld is ∇ · v = ∂vx ∂x + ∂vy ∂y + ∂vz ∂z . The divergence of a vector ﬁeld a produces a scalar ﬁeld equal to the net ﬂux of a out of each point in space. The divergence is a very important operator in ﬂuid mechanics, as it appears in the equation that governs the conservation of mass for a ﬂow ﬁeld, the continuity equation. We will see this in more detail in the following sections. A word of caution: for the expression for ∇ · v in curvilinear coordinates things get a bit more complicated. For example, in cylindrical polars, and borrowing the expression for ∇ from section 1.7 of Lecture 1, we have ∇ · v = ( ˆer ∂ ∂r + ˆeθ 1 r ∂ ∂θ + ˆez ∂ ∂z ) · (vrˆer + vθˆeθ + vzˆez) . Try to work on the above expression, noting that the unit vectors now have some non-zero derivatives (but also that they are orthogonal to each other and certain products cancel out). You will see this in the Vector Calculus course. After some algebra, you should arrive to ∇ · v = ∂vr ∂r + vr r + 1 r ∂vθ ∂θ + ∂vz ∂z . This is just as an example of how careful one needs to be when operating in curvilinear coordinates, especially because unit vectors have non-zero derivatives. 3 2.3 The law of conservation of mass We have met the law of conservation of mass in 1A Fluids in its integral form. We could apply it to a control volume, for instance to the ﬂow in a pipe: We can also introduce the mass ﬂux, deﬁned as the ﬂow of mass per unit area per unit time. For example, the mass ﬂux at entry to the control volume above is: Let us now apply the same law to a small rectangular volume of space, with depth δz into the page. For simplicity we assume that vz = 0. In a time δt, the change in mass, δM , is given by { ρvxδyδz − ( ρ + ∂ρ ∂x δx) ( vx + ∂vx ∂x δx) δyδz + ρvyδxδz − (ρ + ∂ρ ∂y δy) ( vy + ∂vy ∂y δy) δxδz} δt ⇒ δM δt = − ( ∂(ρvx) ∂x + ∂(ρvy) ∂y ) δxδyδz But M = ρδxδyδz so the δxδyδz cancels and, as δt tends to zero, we obtain: ∂ρ ∂t = − ( ∂(ρvx) ∂x + ∂(ρvy) ∂y ) = − [ ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ] · [ ρvx ρvy ] = This is the law of conservation of mass in diﬀerential form: the rate of change of mass per unit volume (density) is the net rate at which mass ﬂows out of the volume. This method of deriving the formula is easy to understand physically but requires some messy maths. A more rigorous derivation uses Gauss’ theorem, but is harder to visualize. You will see it in the Vector Calculus course. 4 2.4 Incompressible ﬂow vs. the equation of state of gases The equation of state of a ﬂuid gives the relationship between the density, ρ, the pressure, p, and the temperature, T . There is no universal equation of state that accurately models the properties of all ﬂuids under all conditions. Instead, various diﬀerent models are used. The most familiar model is that for an ideal gas: ρ = p/(RT ). A more sophisticated model is the Van der Waals equation of state, which accounts for the ﬁnite volume occupied by the molecules themselves. Depending on the problem, one model may be more suitable than another. For liquids, the model ρ = constant is generally a very good one. At low velocities and moderate temperature and pressure gradients, even gases can be approximated as having uniform density quite accurately. In the rest of the Fluid Mechanics course, we will assume ρ = constant. Under this condition, the ﬂow is called incompressible, and calculations become easier. For example, the continuity equation: ∂ρ ∂t = −∇ · (ρv) becomes simply ∇ · v = 0. 2.5 Worked example - Uniform source ﬂow. Source in a free stream ﬂow If we were to heat up a ﬂuid at a point in space, perhaps with a laser, its density would drop at that point (∂ρ/∂t negative), and the ﬂuid would diverge away from that point, i.e. ∇ · (ρv) would be positive. The point would become a ﬂow source. In two dimensions, a uniform source ﬂow could be obtained by injecting ﬂow steadily at a point. ‹ If the ﬂow is (elsewhere than at the source) incompressible, use the continuity equation to show that the velocity is inversely proportional the distance r to the source, vr = C/r The ﬁrst thing to note is that, because of the axisymmetry of the ﬂow, the velocity must be aligned with r and its magnitude depend only on r, v = vr(r) ˆer. It would then be sensible to use polar coordinates, so that the divergence, which must be zero, is given by the expression we found in section 2.2, which simpliﬁes to 5 ∇ · v = ∂vr ∂r + vr r + 1 r ∂vθ ∂θ + ∂vz ∂z = ∂vr ∂r + vr r Since the problem only depends on r, the partial derivatives ∂/∂r are actually ab- solute derivatives d/dr. The diﬀerential equation and its solution are dvr dr = −vr r =⇒ vr(r) = C r . ‹ Choosing a suitable control volume, ﬁnd the value of the constant of integration C for a volumetric ﬂow rate Q at the source Once again, we can exploit the axisymmetry of the problem by choosing a volume with circular boundaries concentric with the source. The mass entering the volume through the inner boundary per unit time must be ρQ, and so must also be the mass leaving through the outer boundary. -Mass ﬂow rate through 1 : ∫ 2πr1 0 ρ v1 ds1 = 2πρv1r1 = ρQ -Mass ﬂow rate through 2 : ∫ 2πr2 0 ρ v2 ds2 = 2πρv2r2 = ρQ Therefore, vr(r) = C r = Q 2πr . Note that we could have used this control volume to show that vr must be inversely proportional to r, but only because of the very easy symmetry of this particular case. The diﬀerential approach is in general more versatile. ‹ Using Cartesian coordinates, check that the divergence is zero also in this coordinate system The aim of this question is to illustrate how ∇ is independent of the coordinate system, and that even if the expressions for the gradient or the divergence are more complicated in curvilinear coordinates, they may make the algebra of some problems simpler, provided certain symmetries exist. 6 First, we would need to express the velocity in Cartesian coordinates, v = Q 2πr ˆer = Q 2πr cos θˆex + Q 2πr sin θˆey = Q 2πr x r ˆex + Q 2πr y r ˆey = = Q 2π x x2 + y2 ˆex + Q 2π y x2 + y2 ˆey. From here, the diﬀerentiation is straightforward, albeit tedious. (Now think how you would obtain in Cartesian coordinates an expression for the divergence for a generic vr, if you did not know how it depends on r, and if you could deduce from it that vr must be inversely proportional to r). ‹ If the above source ﬂow is superimposed with a free stream ﬂow Uˆex, the result- ing ﬂow is still incompressible (check this). Sketch the resulting streamlines. What would be the position of the resulting stagnation point? source ﬂow ∼ r−1; free stream ∼ r0 ⇒ near the source: ⇒ far from source: The stagnation point needs to satisfy vy = 0 and vx = 0, and therefore y = 0 and U + Q 2π x x2 + y2 = 0, or x = Q 2πU ‹ If we now superimpose to the above -uniform free stream plus source- a sink ﬂow of ﬂow rate −Q with the sink located along the x axis a distance d down- stream from the source, how does the ﬂow look? large d small d Note that the streamlines connecting the stagnation points do not allow ﬂow through. This property is sometimes exploited to represent solid obstacles as com- binations of sinks and sources. When the distance d between the source and the sink becomes vanishingly small, the aggregate is called a doublet. 7 2.6 The curl of a vector ﬁeld. Vorticity Just like ∇ can be dotted with a vector a to obtain the divergence, it can also be crossed to obtain the curl ∇ × a. The curl is also very important in ﬂuid mechanics, because the curl of the velocity is the vorticity ω, ω = ∇ × v The vorticity turns out to be twice the angular velocity of the ﬂuid. It has a key role in ﬂow dynamics and is intimately related to dissipation processes, but in this course we will only be concerned with one aspect of it. In IA Fluids you learned how to apply Bernoulli’s equation along streamlines. This is a conservative approach, but it isn’t quite the whole story. In Lecture 3 we will see that Bernoulli’s equation can be applied across streamlines, but only when there is zero vorticity between them. We will only be concerned with vorticity insofar as to whether it is zero, and therefore Bernoulli can be applied across streamlines. For illustrative purposes, let us look at the expression of vorticity for a two-dimensional ﬂow. ω = ∇×v =   ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z   ×   vx vy 0   = z y x Note that, just like the angular velocity, the vorticity is oriented along the local axis of rotation of the ﬂow. It is also important to note that ﬂuids can move along curved paths without actually rotating. For instance, in a plughole vortex, only the ﬂuid near the centre has non-zero vorticity. The ﬂuid particles away from the centre move along circular paths but keep facing in the same direction. You can test this by putting a match- stick cross on the water surface. Over the plughole: ‹ the ﬂuid spins quickly (high shear); ‹ viscous forces are strong; ‹ the ﬂow has non-zero vorticity. Away from the plughole the cross keeps pointing in the same direction ‹ low shear; ‹ viscous forces are weak; ‹ the ﬂow has zero vorticity. =⇒ The ﬂow is irrotational 8 2.7 Changes due to motion through a ﬁeld. Advection The contour lines on this map of Snowdonia show average height above sea level. At every point (x, y), this two-dimensional scalar height ﬁeld has a single value of h(x, y). As you walk along a path at a certain velocity v at what rate does your height change? The operator gives the variation (of h) following v. The rate of change of your height is given by v ·∇h. We can write this as v ·(∇h) or as (v ·∇)h. These are equivalent but the second version becomes more convenient later because (v · ∇) is a scalar operator that acts on anything to its right preserving its dimension. In this case it acts on h, but it may act on any ﬁeld variable. (v · ∇) =     vx vy vz   ·   ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z     = ( vx ∂ ∂x + vy ∂ ∂y + vz ∂ ∂z ) Note that (v · ∇) is not the same as (∇ · v), (∇ · v) =     ∂/∂x ∂/∂y ∂/∂z   ·   vx vy vz     = (∂vx ∂x + ∂vy ∂y + ∂vz ∂z ) 9 The streamlines and the pressure ﬁeld in a steady ﬂow around a cylinder are shown below. Let us follow a ‘blob’ of ﬂuid, or ﬂuid particle, through this pressure ﬁeld. The ﬂuid particle is big enough that it contains many billions of molecules, so that we can average the molecular motion and speak meaningfully about the ﬂuid particle’s velocity and pressure. But it is small enough that we can consider it as being at a single point in the ﬁeld. As part of the ﬂuid, the particle must move along a streamline. At what rate does its pressure change? streamlines pressure contours The rate of change of the ﬂuid particle’s pressure is given by (v · ∇)p. 10 Engineering Tripos 1B Paper 4 Fluid Mechanics Lecture 3 - Inviscid ﬂow ‹ The material derivative ‹ Newton’s second law (f = ma) applied to a ﬂuid: Euler’s equations ‹ Euler’s equations integrated along a streamline: Bernoulli’s equation ‹ Bernoulli’s equation and streamline curvature ‹ Determining the pressure ﬁeld from a ﬂow’s streamlines Ricardo Garcia-Mayoral r.gmayoral@eng.cam.ac.uk 1 3.1 The material derivative Let us recall the steady ﬂow around a cylinder from the end of last lecture. When water ﬂows steadily past a cylindrical obstacle, its height follows the same pattern as that of the pressure deeper within, which helps us visualize how the pressure behaves. Let us focus on a small ‘blob’ of ﬂuid, small enough that it can be considered as a point travelling through the ﬂuid ﬁeld on the macroscopic level–yet containing a very large number of molecules on the microscopic level. This is known as a ﬂuid parcel or ﬂuid particle. We know from section 2.7 that the change in pressure expe- rienced by a ﬂuid particle as it moves with the ﬂow is dp dt = (v · ∇)p When the ﬂow is unsteady, the pressure ﬁeld changes with time and we need to add on the unsteady component: dp dt = ∂p ∂t \f \f \f \f(x,y,z)=constant + (v · ∇)p 2 This is one of the most powerful concepts in ﬂuid mechanics. Gabriel Stokes found himself using this derivative ‘following the blob’ so much that he gave it a name, the material derivative, and its own notation: D Dt = ( ∂ ∂t + v · ∇) It is coordinate-free (i.e. the deﬁnition does not depend on the coordinate system being used). Being an operator, it is hungry for something to diﬀerentiate. For instance, we can use it to ﬁnd the acceleration of a ﬂuid particle by diﬀerentiating its velocity: dv dt = Dv Dt = ∂v ∂t + v · ∇ v acceleration of ﬂuid particle rate of change of v at a ﬁxed point in space (x, y, z) change in v due to the motion through the ﬁeld (with velocity v!) We refer to the description of ﬂuids following its particles as a Lagrangian de- scription, and to its description looking at ﬁxed points in space as the Eulerian description. Lagrangian description Eulerian description Following ﬂuid particles At ﬁxed points in space d dt D Dt ( = ∂ ∂t + v · ∇) 3 3.2 Newton’s second law: f = ma If we put a neutrally buoyant solid cube into a ﬂuid ﬂow and ignore all the viscous forces, we can work out the net force on the cube by considering the pressure on each face: f =   fx fy fz   = −   ∂p/∂x ∂p/∂y ∂p/∂z   δxδyδz = − ∇p δxδyδz Now we write f = ma for the cube: We could do this for an imaginary cube, that is, for a ﬂuid particle. Similarly, we would ﬁnd that the particle is being accelerated or decelerated by the pressure gradients in the ﬂow. However, we know how to express the acceleration of a ﬂuid particle in terms of the ﬂuid’s velocity ﬁeld because we have worked it out in Section 3.1. We can combine all this to get: These are the Euler equations, which become the Navier-Stokes equations when vis- cous terms are included (see p9 of the databook, where it is shown in its steady form and called by its other name: the momentum equation). Euler’s equations are simply f = ma applied to an inviscid ﬂuid. Remember that there is one equation for each dimension. For example in 3D cartesian coordinates there is one equation in the x-direction, one in the y-direction and one in the z-direction. 4 Link to 1st year Momentum Equation In the 1st year you derived the Steady Flow Momentum Equation (SFME) and the more general Momentum Equation (p7 of databook) by considering a control volume: d dt ∫ V ol ρv dV + ∫ Surf ρv(v · dA) = F − ∫ Surf p dA rate of change of momentum in the volume net rate at which momentum enters the volume body forces (e.g. gravity) pressure forces on the surface Euler’s equations are the same thing, but in vector notation and diﬀerential form: ∂ρv ∂t + ρ(v · ∇)v = body forces − ∇p While the Steady Flow Momentum Equation gives information on the ﬂuid vari- ables only in an integral sense, overall in the control volume, the Euler equations give information at each point in space. Once you know a bit more vector calculus, you will be able to derive one from the other by spatial integration/diﬀerentiation: When gravity, −ρgˆez, acts on the ﬂuid (and, in fact, for any other conservative force), its expression as a potential −∇ρgz allows us to embed it in the pressure gradient term. This will be very useful in Lecture 7. ∂ρv ∂t + ρ(v · ∇)v = −ρgˆez − ∇p = −∇ρgz − ∇p = −∇ (p + ρgz) 5 3.3 Euler’s equations applied along a straight streamline We will look at the central streamline of the steady ﬂow around a cylinder. The ﬂuid on this streamline ﬂows at velocity V in the x-direction. This streamline is easy to examine because the streamline coordinate system is aligned with the cartesian coordinate system. The more general case is considered in the next section. The cartesian unit vectors are (ex, ey) and ∇ is deﬁned as ∇ ≡ ex∂/∂ x + ey∂/∂y. Euler’s equations (for an incompressible ﬂuid) are: ρ ∂v ∂t + ρ(v · ∇)v = −∇p but the y-velocity is zero and the ﬂow is steady, so it becomes: ‹ Along ˆex: ‹ Along ˆey: Re-arranging the ex component gives: ∂ ∂x ( 1 2ρV 2) + ∂p ∂x = 0 ∂ ∂x ( p + 1 2ρV 2) = 0 and this can be integrated along the streamline to give: This is Bernoulli’s equation, obtained from f = ma in the absence of viscous forces. When integrated along the streamline, the force terms become energy terms in ex- actly the same way that the change in potential energy of a mass in a gravitational ﬁeld is equal to the force integrated over the distance it moves. Indeed, the cal- culation can easily be repeated with gravity, which introduces an extra ρgz term. So each term can be thought of as an energy per unit volume. In an inviscid ﬂow, Bernoulli’s equation applies along any streamline, as we will see next. Furthermore, if there is no vorticity in the ﬂow then the total pressure is uniform and we can apply Bernoulli’s equation across streamlines. You will prove this when solving question 5 in Examples Paper 1. 6 3.4 Bernoulli and streamline curvature We can do the same analysis for ﬂows in which the streamlines are not aligned with the cartesian coordinate system. The maths here is non-examinable but it is important to understand the result. The great advantage of vector notation is that it applies in any coordinate system: Cartesian coordinates Instrinsic (streamline) coordinates ∇ ≡ ex ∂ ∂x + ey ∂ ∂y ∇ ≡ es ∂ ∂s + en ∂ ∂n The advantage is that the unit vectors ex and ey do not change. The advantage is that the velocity vec- tor is simply v = V es. The disadvan- tage is that the unit vectors change as you go along a streamline. For exam- ple, ∂es/∂s = −en/R, where R is the radius of curvature at that point on the streamline. The Euler equations in steady ﬂow can be re-arranged to: v · ∇v = − 1 ρ ∇p Applying the intrinsic deﬁnition of ∇ and noting that es · es = 1 and es · en = 0: [ V es · (es ∂ ∂s + en ∂ ∂n )] (V es) = V ∂(V es) ∂s = V ( ∂V ∂s es + V ∂es ∂s ) = V ∂V ∂s es − V 2 1 R en = − 1 ρ ( ∂p ∂s es + ∂p ∂n en ) Resolving separately in the es and en directions gives: V ∂V ∂s = − 1 ρ ∂p ∂s along a streamline (as in 3.3) ⇒ tangencial acceleration V 2 R = 1 ρ ∂p ∂n across a streamline (new) ⇒ centripetal acceleration The ﬁrst of these integrates to give Bernoulli’s equation, as before. The second describes how streamlines are bent by pressure gradients. Both equations are given on p9 of the databook. 7 3.5 Determining the pressure ﬁeld from a knowledge of the streamlines Now we have the tools to determine the pressure ﬁeld in a ﬂow from a knowledge of the streamline shape. Along streamlines we can use Bernoulli’s equation. Across streamlines we need to look at the streamline curvature. Aerofoil at positive angle of attack: streamlines pressure contours Close-up of leading edge: Along streamlines Across streamlines • streamlines spread out • streamlines bend • velocity decreases • there must be a trans- verse pressure gradient • pressure increases 8 3.6 Worked example - curved streamlines A uniform water two-dimensional jet of density ρ, velocity V0 and width h enters at A a semi-cylindrical surface, of radius r2, supported at its mid-point B. The ﬂow may be assumed steady and inviscid, and to have semi-circular streamlines between A and C. ‹ Show, from ﬁrst principles, that the pressure p at radius r in the jet satisﬁes the relation dp/dr = ρV 2/r, where V (r) is the jet velocity. We can write the force balance on a curved ﬂuid element: (f = ma) p δℓ − (p + dp dr δr) δℓ = −ρ (δℓδr) V 2 r dp dr = ρ V 2 r (note that this is analogous to the expression in Section 3.4 for streamline curvature, which would however hold even when the streamlines are not circular) ‹ The pressure in the uniform part of the jet is equal to the ambient pressure pa. Write down an equation linking the pressure and velocity in the semi-circular region to pa and V0. Hence ﬁnd V (r) in terms of V0, r and r1. You may assume that the pressure at r = r1 is also pa. Applying Bernoulli along streamlines, we have: pa + 1 2 ρV 2 0 = p(r) + 1 2 ρV (r) 2 9 Diﬀerentiating: 0 = dp dr + ρV dV dr And using the result from the previous question: 0 = ρ V 2 r + ρV dV dr −dr r = dV V ⇒ V (r) = C r At r = r1, p = pa, and therefore –using Bernoulli– V = V0, so V (r) = V0 r1 r ‹ Use the expression obtained for V (r) to obtain the relationship between r1, r2, and h. Applying the integral form of the continuity equation: ∫ r2 r1 V dr = constant ⇒ V0 h = ∫ r2 r1 V0 r1 r dr = V0 r1 ∫ r2 r1 dr r = V0 r1 log r2 r1 (note that in the limit r2 − r1 ≪ r2, log r2 r1 = log (1 + r2 − r1 r1 ) ≈ r2 − r1 r1 , and therefore r2 − r1 ≈ h. In that case, the jet maintains its thickness) ‹ If the pressure on the outside of the semi-cylinder is pa, ﬁnd the pressure diﬀerence across it, and the bending moment at B per unit of cylinder length into the page. Using Bernoulli, the pressure on the inside of the cylinder is p(r2) + 1 2 ρ ( V0 r1 r2 )2 = pa + 1 2 ρV 2 0 , p(r2) = pa + 1 2 ρV 2 0 [ 1 − ( r1 r2 )2] , and the pressure jump across the cylinder is ∆p = 1 2 ρV 2 0 [ 1 − (r1 r2 )2] . From here, the force on each element of the cylinder can be easily obtained, as well as its contribution to the bending moment at B. 10 Engineering Tripos 1B Paper 4 Fluid Mechanics Lecture 4 - Viscous ﬂow ‹ Viscosity and shear – recap ‹ The no-slip condition ‹ Viscous ﬂow between parallel plates ‹ Couette ﬂow ‹ Poiseuille ﬂow ‹ The Navier-Stokes equations Ricardo Garcia-Mayoral r.gmayoral@eng.cam.ac.uk 1 4.1 Viscosity and shear – recap In a viscous ﬂow, like a treacle, the molecules in the ﬂuid do not have deﬁned positions. When one layer is displaced, the molecules ﬂow over each other to ac- commodate the displacement. There is a shear stress during that displacement, but once the motion stops and static equilibrium is reached, the shear stress disappears. −→ -so long as shear is applied the ﬂuid keeps deforming -when shearing ends the ﬂuid stays in new equilibrium Experimentally, it is observed that adjacent layers of conventional ﬂuids exchange momentum at a rate that is proportional to the velocity gradient. By Newton’s sec- ond law, f = ma, the rate of change of momentum across a certain area is simply a force. When divided by the area, this is the shear stress τ : In a certain time and over a certain area, some molecules swap places The coeﬃcient of proportionality is the viscosity, µ: τ = µ dvx dy If the ﬂow is inviscid, µ = 0 and the ﬂow is free to slip. It cannot support any shear stress at all, and the tangential velocity of the ﬂuid in contact with the surface is completely independent from the velocity of the surface itself. ‹ no shear stress ‹ the ﬂow sleeps freely over the surface 2 4.2 The no-slip condition and momentum transfer Let us consider the molecules in a gas between two plates, where the top plate moves from left to right. From experiments we ﬁnd that the molecules stick to surfaces for long enough to reach thermal equilibrium before they jump back into the gas. Consequently when they leave the surface they have, on average, the same x-velocity and the same temperature as the surface. This is the no slip condition. The molecules that have just left the surface collide into molecules nearby. After several collisions the extra x-momentum of the molecules coming from the top sur- face has been diﬀused into adjacent layers of ﬂuid. These in turn jostle with the molecules adjacent to them, transferring x-momentum deeper into the ﬂuid. Even- tually x-momentum diﬀuses right down to the bottom plate and, averaging over all the molecules’ velocities, one obtains a linear velocity proﬁle. This is just like diﬀusion of heat, in which one obtains a linear temperature proﬁle. 3 4.3 Viscous ﬂow between parallel plates Let us consider steady, incompressible, viscous ﬂows between two parallel plates. In these ﬂows, the streamlines are straight and aligned with the plates, so from conti- nuity the velocity is uniform along the ﬂow direction. The ﬂow acceleration is then zero everywhere: dv dt = Dv Dt = ( ∂ ∂t + v · ∇) v = ∂v ∂t + ( vx ∂ ∂x + vy ∂ ∂y ) v As there is no acceleration and f = ma, the forces on a control volume must sum zero: net force along x = net force along y = As we have seen, τ is a function of the velocity (of its gradient, actually), and since the velocity is uniform along x, from the force balance along y we have ∂p ∂y = ∂τ ∂x = 0 ⇒ 4 Looking now at the force balance along x, from our molecular argument we know that we can model the shear stress in terms of the viscosity of the ﬂuid and the velocity gradient as τ = µdvx/dy, so we have As vx depends only on y, then so must µd2vx/dy2, and therefore dp/dx. But we also had, p = p(x), so the only compatible possibility is that dp/dx must be a constant. 4.4 Couette ﬂow When one of the plates of the previous section moves parallel to the other with ve- locity V , the ﬂow is known as ‘Couette ﬂow’. In Couette ﬂow, the pressure gradient is zero so the balance of forces reduces to: This has a solution of the form vx = By + C. The constants B and C are given by the boundary conditions: vx = By + C boundary conditions  || || vx(y = 0) = 0 vx(y = H) = V 5 4.5 Poiseuille ﬂow Let us now consider the ﬂow between stationary plates driven by a constant pressure gradient. The velocity proﬁle is obtained from a force balance on the same control volume: dτ dy δyδx − dp dxδxδy = 0 ⇒ dτ dy = dp dx ⇒ ⇒ vx = ( 1 2µ dp dx ) y2 + By + C boundary conditions  |||| |||| ⇒ vx = − ( 1 2µ dp dx ) (H 2 4 − y2) 4.6 Viscous ﬂow down a slope A similar force balance can be performed on a steady viscous ﬂow down a slope. ‹ along x: ‹ along y: 6 4.7 Combined Couette and Poiseuille ﬂow What happens when we combine Couette and Poiseuille ﬂow? The force balance and the equation of motion are the same but the boundary conditions are diﬀerent. Depending on the sign of dp/dx, there are two types of solutions: (a) Pressure pushes in the direction of the top plate’s motion (favourable pressure gradient): ‹ vx = vx(y) is parabolic ‹ steep velocity gradient dvx/dy at bottom plate (b) Pressure pushes in the opposite direction to the top plate’s motion (adverse pressure gradient): ‹ vx = vx(y) is parabolic ‹ the velocity proﬁle may reverse near the bottom wall When the top plate moves one way and the pressure gradient pushes the other, there is a competition between the diﬀusion of momentum downwards from the top plate and the adverse pressure depleting that momentum, and the ﬂow can reverse direction. A similar mechanism plays a critical role in boundary layers, as we will see in Lecture 8. A worked example of this ﬂow can be found on the Moodle website. 7 4.8 The Navier-Stokes equations The Navier-Stokes equations are the most important equations in ﬂuid mechanics. They are introduced brieﬂy here, and this is non-examinable. We derive them for- mally in the third year. In Lecture 3 we derived the Euler equations, which are f = ma for an inviscid ﬂuid: −∇p = ρ ∂v ∂t + ρv · ∇v When the shear stresses are included, there are extra force terms on the left hand side. These are shown here for a Newtonian, incompressible ﬂuid such as water or air: µ ∂2v ∂x2 + µ∂2v ∂y2 + µ∂2v ∂z2 − ∇p = ρ ∂v ∂t + ρv · ∇v In vector notation, this can be written as: µ(∇ · ∇)v − ∇p = ρ ∂v ∂t + ρv · ∇v which is abbreviated to: µ∇ 2v − ∇p = ρ ∂v ∂t + ρv · ∇v These are the Navier-Stokes equations. They are f = ma for a viscous ﬂuid. They are normally written the other way round and divided by ρ : ∂v ∂t + v · ∇v = − 1 ρ ∇p + µ ρ ∇2v The Navier-Stokes equations are very hard to solve in general, and not even a proof of the existence and uniqueness of their solution exists. There are only solutions for certain simple problems, with special symmetries or for which several of the terms in the equations are negligible. It is often the case that diﬀerent terms can be neglected in diﬀerent regions of a ﬂow. Identifying those regions, which simpliﬁed equations hold in them, and combining the diﬀerent local solutions is an ubiquitous challenge in ﬂuid mechanics. 8 4.9 Worked example - viscous pipe ﬂow We would like to work out the velocity proﬁle vx(r) in a pipe of radius R with a pressure gradient dp/dx. The control volume is a cylindrical shell of thickness δr and length δx. Note that the outer surface of this shell has a larger area than the inner surface. We assume that vx and τ only vary in the r-direction and that p only varies in the x-direction, which means that our partial derivatives become ordinary derivatives. If the ﬂow is steady and R is constant, the forces on the ﬂuid element must sum to zero: (2πrδr)p − (2πrδr) ( p + dp dx δx) + 2π(r + δr) (τ + dτ dr δr) δx − (2πrτ )δx = 0 Multiplying out the brackets, cancelling terms and dropping the very small (δr)2 term gives −(2πrδr) dp dxδx + 2πr dτ dr δrδx + 2πδrτ δx = 0 which reduces to − dp dx + dτ dr + τ r = 0 Now we substitute in τ = µdvx/dr: − dp dx + µ d 2vx dr2 + µ r dvx dr = 0 9 As in the 2D case, we need to integrate this twice in order to ﬁnd vx(r). However, this is diﬃcult when there are three terms. The clever trick is to notice that the second two terms can be re-written as a single term, − dp dx + µ r d dr (r dvx dr ) = 0 Now we integrate this, leaving in constants (A and B) instead of specifying the bounds of the integration: µ r d dr ( r dvx dr ) = dp dx ⇒ r dvx dr = ∫ dp dx r µ dr = dp dx r2 2µ + B ⇒ dvx dr = dp dx r 2µ + B r ⇒ ∫ dvx = ∫ dp dx r 2µdr + ∫ B r dr ⇒ vx = dp dx r2 4µ + B ln r + A For the present conﬁguration, the constants A and B can be found by imposing the no slip condition at the pipe wall, vx(r = R) = 0 and that the solution is not singular at r = 0, which forces B = 0. From these we ﬁnally obtain the solution, vx = − dp dx ( R2 − r2 4µ ) We can recognise the parabolic proﬁle, analogous to that of Poiseuille ﬂow between two plates. 10 Engineering Tripos 1B Paper 4 Fluid Mechanics Lecture 5 - Dimensional analysis and scaling ‹ Introduction ‹ Example - Drag on a sphere ‹ The π theorem ‹ The dimensionless form of Navier-Stokes equations ‹ Order-of-magnitude analysis ‹ Example - An oriﬁce plate ‹ Example - An aeroplane ‹ Example - Drag force on a ship Ricardo Garcia-Mayoral r.gmayoral@eng.cam.ac.uk 1 5.1 The power of dimensional analysis - A historical note Dimensional analysis is a very powerful tool, because it allows us to say a lot of things about problems for which we have very little information. It is an essential tool in ﬂuid mechanics, as it often allows us to circumvent the impossibility to solve Navier-Stokes equations. It also allows us to minimise the number of experiments required to characterize a given phenomenon, and to obtain results applicable to a problem too big or too expensive from a down-scaled model. A famous historical example of the power of dimensional analysis is the study of an atomic blast by G.I. Taylor. In 1941, he was tasked by the Ministry of Home Security to estimate the amount of energy that would be released by the explosion of an atomic bomb. The subsequent work was kept classiﬁed for some years but eventually was made available to the public in 1950. The US Government kept the data from their nuclear tests secret for even longer, but had released some photographs of the ﬁrst detonation of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test, believing that these did not contain any sensitive information. In his 1950 paper, however, Taylor applied dimensional analysis to those pho- tographs and estimated the power of the US blast to be between 17 and 24 kilotons. After he published his work, Taylor was “mildly admonished by the US Army for publishing his deductions.” When the data from the Trinity test was eventually declassiﬁed, the actual power turned out to be about 20 kilotons. Taylor had antic- ipated the result from very little information –so little that the US had released it thinking that it was not relevant. 2 5.2 Dimensional analysis through an example - Drag on a sphere To illustrate how dimensional analysis works, let us use the example of the drag force on a sphere. In the case of viscous, incompressible ﬂow, the drag would be made up of the pressure and shear forces on the sphere, D = ∫ Σ [−pen + τ et]x dσ. To obtain the value of D we would then need to solve the ﬂow around the sphere, determined by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with boundary conditions v = 0 on the sphere and v = V∞ex and p = P∞ far away from it. In incompressible ﬂows, only the derivatives of the pressure appear in the equations, so we can subtract P∞ everywhere without changing the solution, thereby eliminating P∞ as a parameter. The solution for D will then be of the form We can now start our dimensional analysis. The ﬁrst thing to note is that, as you saw in IA Dimensional Analysis, the laws of nature are dimensionally consistent. For instance f = ma will hold no matter what scale we decide to use to measure f , m and a. If we had for instance 6N = 3kg × 2m/s 2, and decided for some reason to measure distances in centimetres instead of meters, but keeping the set of units self- consistent, we would need to carry this into any derived magnitude, like the force or the acceleration. We would then have 600cN = 3kg×200cm/s 2, so the equality –and Newton’s law– would still hold. The idea of a metre, or of a centimetre, are human conventions completely extraneous to nature itself, and cannot therefore play any role in the laws of physics. In the problem of the sphere, this tells us that the solution for D cannot depend on the scale that we choose to measure, say, the radius R or any other distance in the problem. We may choose to measure the radius as 50cm, 0.5m, or in fact, 1 radius, 1R. This would actually be a rather natural choice as a scale for lengths in our problem. Following the choice of R as the length scale, we would need to carry it into any derived magnitude. Let us look at which magnitudes are fundamental and which derived: 3 [D] = ; [R] = ; [ρ] = ; [V∞] = ; [µ] = . We would then need to rescale not only R, which is now 1 in ‘radius units,’ R′ = 1, but also D, ρ, V∞ and µ, taking into account the power of L for each of them. We then have D′ = ; R′ = ; ρ ′ = ; V ′ ∞ = ; µ′ = . Remember that we had the physical relation D = f (R, ρ, V∞, µ), and that it must be invariant. Therefore, we can express it in our new set of scales, for which it will be so, simply by dimensional considerations, we have removed the dependence of the problem on R as an independent entity! But we’ve only just begun. We can rescale the mass with ρ ′ = ρ R3, so that ρ′′ = 1. We would need to carry this rescaling into any magnitude whose dimensions include M , that is D′, ρ′, and µ′. We would then have Finally, we can rescale the time with R/V∞, so that V ′′′ ∞ = 1. Proceeding as before, we obtain, or D ρV 2 ∞R2 = F ( µ ρ V∞ R ) . We have derived this in a step-by-step procedure, but with a bit of practice you will soon get used to doing this in a single step. 4 Notice the implications of the above expression. We have found that the dimen- sionless drag depends only on the dimensionless viscosity. If, for example, we had to ﬁnd the drag on a sphere of size 1 m when immersed in a free stream of air with velocity 10 m/s, we could do a reduced-scale model of size 10 cm and measure the drag in the lab, under a free stream with velocity 1 m/s, if we guaranteed that [ µ ρ V∞ R ] lab = [ µ ρ V∞ R ] real ⇒ [µ ρ ] lab = 1 100 [ µ ρ ] real . We would need to choose the ﬂuid for the experiment accordingly. Once we measure the drag in the lab, the real value would be obtained by rescaling the obtained dimensionless value, Dreal = [ρV 2 ∞R2] real [ D ρV 2 ∞R2 ] lab . Another important implication is that, if we wanted to compile the drag for a wide range of sphere sizes, ﬂow velocities and ﬂuid densities and viscosities, we know that we can reduce the number of measurements substantially, because the solution, when expressed in dimensionless form, depends only on the dimensionless viscosity. There is no end to the applications of this technique in engineering in general, and in ﬂuid problems in particular. It is very frequent to ﬁnd graphs like the one below, which compiles values of the drag coeﬃcient (the dimensionless drag based on the diameter, CD = D/[ρV 2 ∞(2R) 2]) as a function of the Reynolds number (the inverse of the dimensionless viscosity based also on the diameter, ReD = ρ V∞ (2R)/µ). We can plot CD for a sphere as a function of ReD alone. Each point on the line corresponds to the solution for a particular combination ρ V∞ R/µ, and it is valid for all perfectly smooth spheres. We will revisit this problem in Lecture 10, and ﬁnd out why the curve has the irregular shape that it has. 5 5.3 The π theorem The procedure followed in the previous section can be generalised in what is known as the π theorem: If a given physical phenomenon can be represented by a mathematical equation that involves a certain number N of physical variables, and the number of funda- mental dimensions involved is K, the original equation can be rewritten merely in terms of a set of P = N − K dimensionless parameters. For instance, in the example of Section 5.2, we would have: The π theorem is also known as the Buckingham theorem (mostly in English- speaking countries), and also as the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem (elsewhere). It was given by Vaschy in 1892, and by Buckingham in 1914. During this course, we will rarely encounter problems that involve more than three fundamental dimensions, K = 3. These will be those related to dynamics, namely L, T , and M . Problems with richer physics, for instance involving electrical forces, would need additional fundamental dimensions, for instance the electrical charge Q. 6 5.4 The dimensionless form of Navier-Stokes equations So far we have considered dimensional analysis in scenarios where we do not nec- essarily know the equations that govern the motion of the ﬂuid, but the analysis is equally powerful when we know those equations, if not more. We have seen in Lecture 4 that the Navier-Stokes equations are f = ma for a viscous ﬂuid. They are partial diﬀerential equations that must be satisﬁed at every point in the ﬂow. Given a set of boundary and initial conditions and the physical properties of the ﬂuid, the equations have a given solution. Let us imagine that we have two ﬂows that are geometrically similar (i.e. one is a scaled-up version of the other): L1 L2 We can deﬁne equivalent reference lengths and reference velocities in both sit- uations, and measure all distances in these units. In the new units, the boundary conditions for both problems are identical, but the ﬂuid properties ρ and µ are not. x1 = x∗ L1 y1 = y∗ L1 v1 = v∗ V1 t1 = t∗ L1/V1 p1 = p∗ ρ1V 2 1 physical props: ρ1, µ1 x2 = x∗ L2 y2 = y∗ L2 v2 = v∗ V2 t2 = t ∗ L2/V2 p2 = p∗ ρ2V 2 2 physical props: ρ2, µ2 Note also that: ∇1 = ( ∂ ∂x1 ∂ ∂y1 ) = ( ∂ ∂(x∗L1) ∂ ∂(y∗L1) ) = 1 L1 ( ∂ ∂x∗ ∂ ∂y∗ ) = ∇∗ L1 and ∇2 = ∇∗ L2 We may then ask: under what conditions would the solutions for the two prob- lems be identical, other than the obvious answer of equal L, V , ρ and µ? Let us write the dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for both problems side by side, and 7 substitute in x∗, v∗ etc. from the previous page. We can rearrange the resulting expressions so that they depend only on a single dimensionless parameter. We then obtain the non-dimensional form of Navier-Stokes equations for both situations: Big square Small square ρ1 Dv1 Dt = −∇1p1 + µ1(∇1)2v1 ρ2 Dv2 Dt = −∇2p2 + µ2(∇2) 2v2 ρ1 D(v∗V1) D(t∗L1/V1) = −∇ ∗ L1 (p∗ρ1V 2 1 ) + µ1 (∇∗ L1 )2 (v∗V1) ρ2 D(v∗V2) D(t∗L2/V2) = −∇ ∗ L2 (p∗ρ2V 2 2 ) + µ2 ( ∇∗ L2 )2 (v∗V2) Dv∗ Dt∗ = −∇ ∗p∗ + µ1 ρ1V1L1 (∇∗)2v∗ Dv∗ Dt∗ = −∇ ∗p∗ + µ2 ρ2V2L2 (∇∗)2v∗ ⇒ Dv∗ Dt∗ = −∇ ∗p∗ + 1 Re1 (∇∗)2v∗ ⇒ Dv∗ Dt∗ = −∇ ∗p∗ + 1 Re2 (∇∗) 2v∗ If the boundary and initial conditions are identical in ‘*’ variables, for the equations to have exactly the same solution the Reynolds numbers must also be the same. In addition to geometrical similarity, we would then also have dynamical similarity. If there were more physical processes involved in the problem, we could similarly seek complete physical similarity. In our case, the Reynolds number is the only control parameter for geometrically-similar objects. For compressible ﬂows, which are be- yond the scope of this course, there would be an additional control parameter in the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations, the Mach number. 5.5 Order-of-magnitude analysis When we choose typical values of the variables in a problem to write it in dimen- sionless form, as we have done in the previous section by choosing ρi, Vi, Li, µi, the corresponding dimensionless variables are of order one. The resulting dimensionless numbers give us an estimate of the relative importance of the diﬀerent terms in the equations. This procedure can also be done directly on the equations in dimensional form, and is known as order-of-magnitude analysis. ρ ∂v ∂t + ρ v · ∇v = − ∇p + µ∇ 2v 8 5.6 Dimensional analysis - an engineers approach Let us consider the problem of the drag of the sphere, when its surface is rough. A new parameter would then be introduced: the height of the bumps, ϵ. An engineer would seek to reduce the problem to its simplest expression, and could follow the following procedure: Step 1 - Decide which variables you want to measure (the dependent variables) and the variables which have inﬂuence on the problem (the independent variables). Step 2 - Count up the number of fundamental dimensions (mass, length, time, etc.) and subtract this from the number of variables to obtain the number of dimensionless numbers in the problem. Step 3 - Create the dimensionless numbers. There are often several ways to do this but it is usually convenient to use standard dimensionless numbers, such as Reynolds number, Mach number etc. These can be found in the Thermoﬂuids data book. Step 4 - Create an experiment or a numerical simulation to mea- sure the dependent dimensionless number as a function of the inde- pendent control parameters: 9 5.7 Example - An oriﬁce plate In Lecture 7 we will work out the pressure drop across an oriﬁce plate, ∆p, in terms of the average velocity upstream, V , using a simple model of the ﬂow. However, the real ﬂow is more complicated than that assumed by the simple model. In real life, we need to do experiments (or numerical simulations) to obtain more accurate values of ∆p as a function of V . How do we express these in a way that is easily scalable to geometrically-similar oriﬁce plates? Dependent Step 1 variable Independent variables Step 2 - count up the dimensions: Step 3 - create the dimensionless numbers: Step 4 - carry out the experiment: 10 5.8 Example - An aeroplane We want to evaluate the lift and drag coeﬃcients of a Boeing 747 by testing a geometrically-similar model in a wind tunnel. What conditions are required in the wind tunnel for complete similarity? We need to keep in mind that commercial aeroplanes ﬂy at transonic speeds, so the density of the ﬂuid cannot be taken as a constant. Step 1: identify dependent and independent variables Dependent Independent drag, lift ρ, V , L, µ, Step 2: count up the dimensions Step 3: create the dimensionless numbers Dependent Independent CD = drag 1 2 ρV 2A , CL = lift 1 2ρV 2A 11 Step 4 - It is easy to match the angles of attack. However, for complete similarity we require Mm = Mf and Rem = Ref : Mm = Mf and Rem = Ref that is: Vm am = Vf af and ρmVmLm µm = ρf Vf Lf µf re-arranging gives: Vm Vf = am af and Vm Vf = ρf µm ρmµf Lf Lm This is an over-constrained problem: it will not be possible to match both M and Re without manipulating the density and/or the viscosity of the ﬂuid. This can be done for instance by pressurising the wind tunnel, which increases the density of air, or by using cryogenic temperatures, which both increases the density and decreases the viscosity of air, but such solutions are expensive. However, we know from experience that in many cases the Reynolds number has little inﬂuence once it is Re ≳ 10 6. For this reason, wind-tunnel tests typically match the Mach number and let the Reynolds number ﬂoat, ensuring only that it does not drop into the region where it could have inﬂuence. This is called partial or incomplete similarity. 12 5.9 Example - Drag force on a ship Behind a ship there is a wave pattern that propagates energy away from the ship as well as the conventional wake associated with a body. These are surface waves. The restoring force is gravity, so it must be included in the problem. How would we work out the drag force on a full-scale ship by performing model tests? Step 1 - Dependent and independent variables Dependent Independent drag ρ, V , L, µ, Step 2 - Number of dimensions Step 3 - Create the dimensionless numbers (look in Thermoﬂuids data book) Dependent Independent CD = drag 1 2ρV 2L2 Step 4 - Work out conditions for complete similarity, assuming that Vm is unre- stricted: V 2 m gLm = V 2 f gLf and ρmVmLm µm = ρf Vf Lf µf ⇒ µmρf µf ρm = ( Lm Lf )3/2 13 Thus if the model is 1:20 scale, the ratios of the kinematic viscosities, µ/ρ must be 1:89. There are no safe, cheap ﬂuids with such a small viscosity so we cannot force complete similarity. However, we know that CD is some function of Re and F r only. What can we say about the nature of this function, using physical reasoning? Are the Re eﬀects likely to be independent of the F r eﬀects or not? It takes the sea around a day to become calm after a storm -through the action of viscous forces- while the typical period of a wave is around few seconds. Therefore, viscosity can only have a very weak eﬀect on wave motion. Furthermore, gravity can have little eﬀect on the usual wake drag associated with the body, that is, the form and friction drag. Therefore, we can treat the wave drag and the form/friction drag as independent and additive: We can then perform two separate experiments. First, we test the model at the correct Froude number, and measure the total drag. Then, we measure the form and friction drag at that Froude number by testing a completely submerged reﬂected model: We subtract one from the other to obtain the Froude number drag coeﬃcient, CD,wave(F r). For large ships it can be hard to test at the correct Reynolds num- ber, because very large velocities are required. However, we will see in Lecture 10 (External Flow) how to estimate CD,form+fric at large Re. 14 Engineering Tripos 1B Paper 4 Fluid Mechanics Lecture 6 - Pipe Flow ‹ Friction and pressure loss - Dimensional analysis ‹ Laminar ﬂow in a circular pipe ‹ Turbulent ﬂow in a circular pipe ‹ Turbulence, mixing and friction ‹ Roughness Ricardo Garcia-Mayoral r.gmayoral@eng.cam.ac.uk 1 6.1 Friction and pressure loss - Dimensional analysis In Lecture 5 we have seen how we can use dimensional analysis to reduce the number of variables that any physical problem depends on to the minimum set of (dimen- sionless) parameters. Let us now apply this to the ﬂow inside a pipe. We are mainly interested in the pressure drop –or loss– along the pipe, dp/dx. This is because, as we will see in Lecture 7, the pressure loss determines how much ﬂow we can move through the pipe per unit time, and how much power will be required to do so. When the bulk velocity V , deﬁned as the volumetric ﬂowrate divided by the cross- sectional area, is constant in time, the ﬂow experiences zero mean acceleration, and the pressure loss can be directly related to the friction force done by the walls: V = bulk velocity = ﬂow rate cross-sectional area = ⇒ τw = − πR2 2πR dp dx ⇒ τw = −R 2 dp dx The wall shear stress τw is a force per unit area and has dimensions Nm−2, just like the pressure. Let us then apply dimensional analysis to the problem of the friction stress at the pipe walls: Dependent variable Independent variables We can therefore construct a dimensionless friction that will depend only on a single dimensionless parameter (for which the Reynolds number is a good choice). We can nondimensionalise τ with ρV 2, but it is typical to use the dynamic pressure ρV 2/2 instead. The resulting dimensionless number is the friction coeﬃcient, cf , cf = τw 1 2ρV 2 = 2 6.2 Laminar ﬂow in a circular pipe The friction coeﬃcient can be calculated exactly when a viscous ﬂuid is forced slowly down a pipe. The ﬂow takes some length from the entrance to develop fully (we will see in Lecture 8, when we discuss boundary layers, that the development length is proportional to R2), but from there on it becomes independent of x and adopts the familiar Poiseuille velocity proﬁle. The worked example of Lecture 4 (section 4.9) shows one way to derive the velocity proﬁle. An easier way to derive it is to balance the forces on cylindrical elements centred on the centreline: This gives us the velocity gradient in terms of the pressure gradient. We need to work out the velocity proﬁle by integrating the expression and applying the no slip boundary condition: vx = dp dx [ r2 4µ ]r R vx = − dp dx ( R2 − r2 4µ ) 3 Now we need to evaluate the average velocity in the pipe, V , in terms of the pressure drop. The total ﬂowrate divided by the cross-sectional area is V = 1 πR2 ∫ R 0 vx(r)2πrdr = 1 πR2 ∫ R 0 − dp dx ( R2 − r2 4µ ) 2πrdr ⇒ V = − 1 2µR2 dp dx [ R2r2 2 − r4 4 ]R 0 ⇒ V = −R2 8µ dp dx ⇒ dp dx = − 8µ R2 V We have already determined an expression for the friction coeﬃcient, cf , in terms of the pressure drop. Now we can express it in terms of the average ﬂowrate by substituting in the above expression, cf = − R ρV 2 dp dx = R ρV 2 8µV R2 = 8µ ρV R and if we deﬁne the Reynolds number using the diameter D, as is most frequent in hydraulics, we have So for a laminar pipe ﬂow the friction coeﬃcient only depends on the Reynolds number, as shown by dimensional analysis. The results from the lab experiment actually match the theoretical result quite well in the laminar ﬂow region. 4 On a side note, let us recall the order-of-magnitude analysis that we did in Lecture 5, section 5.5: ρ ∂v ∂t + ρ v · ∇v = − ∇p + µ∇ 2v If the advective and the viscous terms are of very diﬀerent order of magnitude, dp/dx will necessarily be of the order of magnitude of whichever is larger. This is what happens at very large and very small Reynolds number –remember that the Reynolds number gives a measure of the relative importance of advective vs. viscous eﬀects. When we deﬁned cf , we did so by forming a dimensionless group for the wall shear stress. For that, we used the dynamic pressure, 1/2ρV 2, but we might as well have used the order-of-magnitude value of the viscous stress, µV /D. This would have been a more convenient choice at low Reynolds number, when viscous terms dominate. Nevertheless, we are interested in always using the same deﬁnition of cf , and we will be more interested in what happens at large Re. cf = τw 1 2ρV 2 = c∗ f = τw µ V D = 5 6.3 Turbulence, mixing and friction If the ﬂow were to remain laminar, the friction coeﬃcient would always decrease with increasing Reynolds number. However, as the Reynolds number increases (in a given pipe and for a given ﬂuid, by increasing V ), the ﬂow is not viscous enough to dissipate all the energy put into it merely by viscous friction, and breaks down into smaller and smaller eddies, down to sizes where viscosity can eventually act. The ﬂow is then highly ﬂuctuating and chaotic, and we say that it has become turbulent. When turbulent, the ﬂow is highly unsteady - the velocity and pressure at a point in space vary with time. However, the time-averaged quantities do have steady values in pipe ﬂow, so we can use these quantities to deﬁne the Reynolds number and the friction coeﬃcient. In a laminar ﬂow, molecular diﬀusion is the only transport process between layers of ﬂuid. Laminar ﬂows are very hard to mix - they need to be folded rather than stirred. In a turbulent ﬂow, packets of ﬂuid move between layers of ﬂuid in turbulent eddies. This occurs on a much larger scale than molecular diﬀusion so the mixing rate is greatly increased. Consequently, the rate of momentum transport in a turbulent ﬂow is much greater than that in a laminar ﬂow. There is a higher rate of momentum transfer from the ﬂuid to the pipe walls, hence a higher shear stress and a greater pressure drop. 6 In Lecture 1 we saw that the transport of momentum due to molecular diﬀusion is modelled by viscosity. In a turbulent ﬂow however, whole eddies move between layers, greatly increasing the rate of transport of momentum. We could model the eﬀect of turbulence by increasing the viscosity by some amount. This added viscos- ity is called the eddy viscosity. laminar: molecular mixing only turbulent: eddy diﬀusion, much larger scale The ‘eddy viscosity’ model illustrates reasonably well the enhanced transport in turbulent ﬂows. Unfortunately, it is a rather crude model, and has only limited usefulness. The value of the eddy viscosity depends on eddy size and intensity, and it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a universal model. The existing models typically have several free constants, which need to be ﬁtted with experimental data (and this defeats the purpose of developing a model!). • Eddy size and intensity vary throughout the ﬂow • No universal model for µT However, we know from dimensional analysis that in a smooth, straight, circular pipe the friction coeﬃcient only depends on the Reynolds number. We can therefore measure that dependence experimentally, resting assured that our measures will be valid for any smooth, straight, circular pipe. 7 6.4 Roughness Roughness increases friction, so we typically try to eliminate it from pipes. However, no matter how smooth a pipe is, it will always have a certain roughness. The roughness of a pipe can be characterized through the ratio of the average bump size to the diameter of the pipe, k/D. laminar ﬂow roughness is too small to be noticed by the ﬂow turbulent, hydrauli- cally smooth turbulent, fully rough smaller eddies interact with walls, friction increases When k/D ≪ 1, a laminar ﬂow does not notice that the pipe walls are rough. Even turbulent ﬂows at moderately low Reynolds numbers do not notice it. This occurs because the ﬂow breaks down into eddies which are still too large to notice the detail of the surface roughness. The ﬂow is then called hydraulically smooth. However, as the Reynolds number increases, eventually the ﬂow breaks down into eddies small enough to interact with the rough bumps. The friction then increases, compared to a hydraulically smooth ﬂow. Eventually, the smallest eddies, for which viscosity is important, are so small that viscosity becomes irrelevant at the length scale of the bumps k. The friction becomes then independent of the viscosity, and thus of the Reynolds number, as it is caused entirely by the pressure drag from the roughness bumps. The turbulent ﬂow is then called fully rough.log(cf) 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 Re From “Str¨omungsgesetze in rauhen Rohren” J.

We saw how, when pressure is the only source of forces acting on the ﬂuid, the quantity p + ρV 2/2 is conserved along streamlines. If gravity is also relevant, then it is the quantity p + ρgh + ρV 2/2 that remains con- stant. We can therefore see that both the pressure and the gravitational potential energy have the capacity to be transformed into ﬂow kinetic energy, and can thus be viewed as forms of stored energy for the ﬂow. In this lecture, we will analyse the loss (or gain) of energy in hydraulics networks, to ﬁnd out the power required by the system or the power that can be extracted from it. In the duct: • Static pressure • Dynamic pressure • Stagnation pressure Let us start by deﬁning static, stagnation and total pressure. The static pressure, p, is the actual pressure at any given point in the ﬂow. It is the pressure that we would measure with a sensor that did not alter the ﬂow velocity, e.g. at point A on the diagram below. We deﬁne the stagnation pressure, p0, as the quantity that would be conserved for an inviscid ﬂow in the absence of gravity eﬀects, p0 = p + 1 2ρV 2. It is the pressure we would measure if we managed to bring the ﬂow to rest without mechanical losses, e.g. at point B on the pitot tube, which is a stagnation point. We will refer to the quantity ρV 2/2 as the dynamic pressure, which is the diﬀerence between the stagnation and static ones. Finally, we deﬁne the total pressure, pT = p + ρgh + 1 2 ρV 2, 2 as the quantity that would be conserved when the work done by gravity is relevant, that is, when changes in height in the ﬂuid are important. In real life, however, all ﬂuids have certain viscosity, so losses are bound to oc- cur and the total pressure is not conserved. We will devote most of Lecture 7 to estimating the losses in diﬀerent parts of a network, so that we can ﬁnd how much energy per unit volume, or rather, total pressure, the ﬂuid has at the end of its course. Hydraulics engineers often talk about heads instead of pressures, as any pressure diﬀerence can be transformed into a height diﬀerence in a static column of liquid, as is done in the diagram on page 2. The head is simply the corresponding ‘pressure’ magnitude divided by ρg, total head = pT ρg = Consider for instance the network sketched above. The ﬂow starts the circuit with a head of 1.5 m. As it passes through the diﬀerent network elements, it will experience diﬀerent mechanical energy losses that we will measure in terms of losses in total pressure. The ﬂow will also undergo a gain of total pressure through the pump, so that there is a net gain that results in a higher ﬁnal head of 8.5m. In long pipes, h may change substantially from one end to the other, so the factor ρgh in pT needs to be taken into account. Along short components, like bends, valves, etc, the change in height can often be neglected and the change in total pressure is then just the change in stagnation pressure, p + ρV 2/2. We will neglect height variations in Sections 7.3 to 7.5, but in any event they could be included in the analysis by simply substituting static pressures, p, for the corresponding values of p + ρgh, as we saw in Lectures 3 and 4. 3 7.2 Loss of total pressure along a pipe In Lecture 6, section 1, we derived an expression for the pressure drop along a pipe in terms of the friction coeﬃcient cf = f (Re), dP dx = −ρV 2 R cf , or, in terms of the pipe diameter, D, dP dx = − 4 D cf ( 1 2ρV 2) . There is an alternative deﬁnition of the friction coeﬃcient, which we will denote f , and which is simply 4cf . In this course we call f the friction factor although in some books it too is called the friction coeﬃcient. If the cross-sectional area is uniform along the pipe, R, V and Re = ρV D/µ are constant, so we have Knowing that the bulk velocity is uniform, we can use this diﬀerence in static pres- sures to obtain the change in total pressure, pT 2 − pT 1 = (p2 + ρgh2 + 1 2 ρV 2 2 ) − ( p1 + ρgh1 + 1 2ρV 2 1 ) = p2 − p1 + ρg (h2 − h1) = = 4 7.3 Loss of total pressure at a pipe discharge When a pipe of constant section ends in a sudden expansion, for instance in a reser- voir or directly into open air, the out-coming ﬂow forms a jet. It is generally safe to assume that the jet streamlines are straight, which implies that there are no nor- mal pressure gradients, so the static pressure in the jet and in the quiescent ﬂuid surrounding it is the same. Furthermore, if the surrounding ﬂuid is air and the discharging one is much denser, like water, the friction between the two, and the associated energy loss, can typically be neglected. • Parallel straight streamlines ⇒ ⇒ • If jet is water into air ⇒ losses negligible When the discharge is into a the same ﬂuid, viscous friction will not be negli- gible and soon turbulent mixing sets in, causing a drop in total pressure. When the discharge is simply a sudden expansion into a new, wider section of the pipe, it is diﬃcult to know the details of the ﬂow in the mixing region. Because of the turbulent dissipation, we cannot apply Bernoulli’s equation, but we can establish a balance between the discharge section and another section further downstream, once the ﬂow is fully developed again: Continuity equation: V2A2 = V3A3 ⇒ V3 V2 = A2 A3 Steady ﬂow momentum equation: p2A3 + ˙mV2 = p3A3 + ˙mV3 Re-arranging the momentum equation we have: p2 − p3 = ˙m A3 (V3 − V2) = ρA2V2 A3 (V3 − V2) = ρV 2 2 ( A2V3 A3V2 − A2 A3 ) Substituting the continuity equation into this expression gives: p2 − p3 = ρV 2 2 ([A2 A3 ]2 − A2 A3 ) 5 If changes in ρgh are negligible, the drop in total pressure is pT 2 − pT 3 =p2 + 1 2ρV 2 2 − p3 − 1 2ρV 2 3 =p2 − p3 + 1 2 ρ(V 2 2 − V 2 3 ) =p2 − p3 + 1 2 ρV 2 2 ( 1 − [ V3 V2 ]2) Substituting we ﬁnally have pT 2 − pT 3 = ρV 2 2 ([A2 A3 ]2 − A2 A3 ) + 1 2ρV 2 2 ( 1 − [A2 A3 ]2) = 1 2ρV 2 2 ( 1 − 2A2 A3 + [A2 A3 ]2) = 1 2ρV 2 2 (1 − A2 A3 )2 = 1 2ρV 2 2 K, where K is the loss coeﬃcient for the sudden expansion. We can compare this value of K with the experimental values compiled below: When a pipe discharges into a reservoir the above model is still valid, but then A3 tends to inﬁnity (or V3 ≈ 0) and the loss coeﬃcient is K = 1. If from A2 to A3 the variation in height was not negligible, we would need to repeat the analysis accounting for it. This can be done by simply replacing p2 with p2 +ρgh2 and p3 with p3 +ρgh3, and the resulting loss of total pressure would still be pT 2 − pT 3 = 1 2ρV 2 2 K. 6 7.4 Loss of total pressure across an oriﬁce plate Oriﬁce plates are used to measure the ﬂowrate through a pipe. The ﬂowrate is cal- culated from the static pressure drop across the plate. The pressure drop depends on the size of oriﬁce, the sharpness of the edges and where the pressure tappings are placed relative to the plate. Oriﬁce plates are calibrated experimentally but here we use a simple model to estimate the pressure drop. We assume that the velocity is, on average, uniform and steady across section 1, section 3 and the central jet in section 2. Section 2 is chosen so that the jet streamlines are locally straight. This implies that there are no normal pressure gradients, so the static pressure is the same across all of section 2. If we assume that there are no viscous losses between section 1 and section 2, then Bernoulli can be applied along each streamline in this region. p1 + 1 2 ρV 2 1 = p2 + 1 2 ρV 2 2 ⇒ p1 − p2 = 1 2ρV 2 1 (V 2 2 V 2 1 − 1 ) If we knew A2/A1 we could calculate V2/V1 from conservation of mass between sections 1 and 2: = ⇒ p1 − p2 = 1 2ρV 2 1 (( A1 A2 )2 − 1 ) Let as now calculate the loss of total pressure across the whole component. Between sections 2 and 3 the jet mixes turbulently and it behaves just like the ﬂow between sections 2 and 3 of Section 7.3, but in addition now V3 = V1 because of continuity. The resulting overall drop in static pressure is 7 p1 − p3 = (p1 − p2) + (p2 − p3) = 1 2 ρV 2 1 ( A1 A2 − 1 )2 = 1 2 ρV 2 1 K, and the total pressure drop (neglecting height variations) is the same, since V3 = V1, pT 1 − pT 3 = p1 + 1 2 ρV 2 1 − p3 − 1 2ρV 2 3 = p1 − p3 = 1 2 ρV 2 1 K . The diﬃculty to determine the loss coeﬃcient, K, lies in determining the posi- tion and value of A2, which is very diﬃcult experimentally. However, we can apply dimensional analysis as in Lecture 5, section 6: Dependent variable Independent variables At the very large Reynolds numbers of pipes, typically larger than Re ≈ 10 6, the problem becomes independent of the actual value of Re, and K is then only a function of the geometry of the oriﬁce. Its values are often tabulated or plotted for diﬀerent oriﬁce shapes: Once more, if the variation in height was not negligible, it could be accounted for by simply replacing p1 with p1 + ρgh1, etc., and the resulting loss of total pressure would still be pT 1 − pT 3 = 1 2ρV 2 1 K. 8 7.5 Changes in total pressure across other network compo- nents There are similar losses of total pressure across other network elements, for instance at the entrance to a pipe: Other components such as valves, junctions and bends cause a similar total pres- sure loss. Dimensional analysis always shows that the loss is of the form ∆pT = 1 2 ρV 2 1 K, where K is a function of Re and the geometry. However, at high Reynolds num- bers the ﬂow is highly turbulent and K becomes Re-independent, leaving only the geometry dependence. The values of K for a wide variety of components has been measured experimentally and is tabulated in books such as Internal Flow Systems by D. S. Miller: 9 7.6 Mechanical work, pumps and turbines Pumps do mechanical work on a ﬂuid to produce a rise in total pressure. Turbines, on the other hand, extract mechanical work from a ﬂuid and cause a total pressure loss. The exact mechanisms of this are described in the third year (3A3 Compress- ible Flow) and the fourth year (Turbomachinery). The losses in total pressure that we have seen in Sections 7.2 to 7.5 correspond to losses in the mechanical energy of the ﬂuid. In all those cases, the losses were due to viscous and turbulent dissipation. It is also possible to transfer part of the ﬂuid’s energy via an energy-extracting device. For instance, a ﬂow can do shaft work on a turbine, exerting a shaft power, ˙Wx, on it. These processes are never perfectly reversible, so some energy is lost to irreversibilities. The total pressure change across a control volume is related to the shaft power extracted from the ﬂuid by ˙m ρ (pTout − pTin) + (irreversibility losses) = − ˙Wx Similarly, if mechanical shaft power is exerted on the ﬂuid then the total pressure rises. Again, the power exerted is equal to the volumetric ﬂowrate multiplied by the total pressure change. 10 7.7 Worked example The network of the ﬁgure has the following friction and loss coeﬃcients (assuming that Re is large enough): cf,pipe = 3.75 × 10 −3, Kinlet = 0.1, Kvalve = 0.5, Korif ice = 0.5, Koutlet = 1.0 Find the power required for the pump to drive Q = 2.75m 3s −1 of water from the left tank to the right tank.

Inviscid ﬂows are governed by Euler equations, ρ ∂v ∂t + ρ (v · ∇v) = −∇p , while viscous ﬂows are governed by Navier-Stokes equations. Comparing both equa- tions, it would be natural to assume that, when the viscous eﬀects are negligible, Navier-Stokes’ equations become Euler’s. Let us look at the order of magnitude of the diﬀerent terms to see when the viscous one would indeed be negligible: ρ ∂v ∂t + ρ (v · ∇v) = −∇p + µ∇ 2v. This shows that the Reynolds number is nothing but a measure of the relative importance of advective versus viscous eﬀects. As the Reynolds number tends to inﬁnity, we would expect the ﬂow to become inviscid. However, this is not entirely true. An inviscid ﬂow would slip over a solid surface, but one with viscosity –small as it may be– will always satisfy the no-slip condition. This is so because viscous eﬀects are never negligible near a wall. In our previous order-of-magnitude analysis, we assumed that variations in v for the viscous term occurred over distances D, but in high-Re ﬂows they occur in very thin layers near the walls, of thickness δ. We call these regions boundary layers, and we can deﬁne a Reynolds number for them, Reδ = ρV δ µ In laminar ﬂows, Reδ turns out to be small enough that viscous eﬀects are important –but only up to a distance ∼ δ from the wall. 2 8.2 Boundary layer growth The previous section oﬀers an intuitive idea of why boundary layers exist, but the concept of boundary layer only attains its full signiﬁcance when the boundary layer is allowed to evolve in the streamwise direction (this does not occur in the fully developed ﬂow in a pipe or between plates, which as we saw in Lectures 4 and 6 is streamwise-uniform). To illustrate this idea, let us consider what happens when a free stream encounters a plate aligned with the ﬂow, or conversely, when a plate advances through a ﬂuid initially at rest. Time evolution for a plate moving through a viscous ﬂuid: Due to the no-slip condition, the ﬂow in immediate contact with the plate must have the same velocity as the plate. Through shear, the ﬂuid layer near the plate will exchange momentum with the layer just above, which will begin to move. This will in turn generate some shear with the next layer above, and so forth. In the frame of reference of the moving plate, if we focus on a ﬁxed x in space, we would observe a y-diﬀusion of momentum away from the plate over time. Con- versely, if we think of the plate as stationary, and the ﬂow moving with respect to it, we would observe that the eﬀect of the no-slip condition propagates farther in y as we move downstream along x. Plate moving, ﬂuid stationary. Plate stationary, ﬂuid moving. The velocity proﬁle is not parabolic, or linear, as it was for the ﬂow between ﬂat plates. In fact, there is no top boundary condition –or it is at inﬁnity– so there is no physical bound limiting the diﬀusion away from the plate of the boundary layer. This gives rise to an entirely diﬀerent solution for the velocity proﬁle, although its curvature can be reminiscent of Poiseuille ﬂow. 3 To obtain an estimate for the growth of the boundary layer thickness, we can revisit the order of magnitude argument of Section 8.1. When viewing the ﬂow as a free stream over a ﬁxed plate, the boundary layer is steady and two-dimensional, and there are no pressure gradients. We then have • continuity: ∇ · v = 0 ∂vx ∂x + ∂vy ∂y = 0 =⇒ Vy ∼ δ x V ρ ∂v ∂t + ρ (v · ∇v) = − ∇p + µ∇ 2v ρ ( vx ∂vx ∂x + vy ∂vx ∂y ) = µ (∂2vx ∂x2 + ∂2vx ∂y2 ) =⇒ δ2 ∼ µ x ρ V ρ (vx ∂vy ∂x + vy ∂vy ∂y ) = − ∂p ∂y + µ ( ∂2vy ∂x2 + ∂2vy ∂y2 ) =⇒ ∂p ∂y ≈ 0 • momentum in x: • momentum in y: We obtain that the wall-normal velocity is much smaller than V , the thickness of the boundary layer increases in proportion to √ x, where x is the distance from the front of the plate, and the wall-normal pressure gradient is negligible, δ ∼ √ µ x ρ V , Vy ∼ δ x V ≪ V, ∂p ∂y ≈ 0. 4 plate has inﬁnite length along x ⇒ the only available lengthscale at each point is the local x 8.3 Bernoulli and boundary layers In Lecture 3, Bernoulli’s equation was derived for inviscid ﬂows, where only pressure and inertial forces are present. Within a boundary layer, viscous forces are impor- tant, which implies that Bernoulli does not hold. We can however still use Bernoulli outside the boundary layer where, by deﬁnition, viscous eﬀects are negligible. This has a very important consequence: for ﬂows with relatively low viscosity, we can solve the ﬂow ﬁeld assuming that it is inviscid –using Euler– if we neglect the the thin boundary layer regions. We could then use that external solution as the bound- ary condition to solve the boundary layer region. outside: viscous forces are negligible inside: viscous forces are important 8.4 Streamline curvature and normal pressure gradients In Section 8.2 we have seen that the wall-normal velocity in the boundary layer is very small. The streamlines are therefore almost wall-parallel and have negligible curvature. We have also seen that the wall-normal pressure gradient is also negligi- ble. For this reason, the pressure at a given point in the boundary layer is essentially the same as that in the free stream just above it. 5 8.5 Boundary layers in ﬂows with a pressure gradient The discussion on boundary layer growth in Section 8.2 was based on the absence of pressure gradients. If these are present the boundary layer is a bit more com- plicated but, qualitatively, the eﬀect is similar to that of pressure gradients on a Couette ﬂow, which we saw in Lecture 4, section 7. In the presence of a favourable pressure gradient, as the ﬂow moves towards low pressures it accelerates, and the velocity proﬁle within the boundary layer becomes fuller. The velocity gradient at the wall becomes steeper and friction increases: (the boundary layer on the opposite wall is also thin so they do not aﬀect each other) If, conversely, the pressure gradient is adverse, the ﬂow decelerates, the boundary layer velocity proﬁle is depleted, the velocity gradient at the wall becomes less steep and the ﬂow can even reverse. 6 8.6 Boundary layer separation The streamlines and pressure ﬁeld of inviscid ﬂow around an ellipse are shown be- low. There are high pressure regions around the front and rear stagnation points. streamlines pressure contours All real ﬂuids are viscous and obey the no slip condition. This means that a thin boundary layer forms around the surface of the ellipse, growing as the ﬂuid moves downstream. Let us imagine for a moment that the boundary layer stuck to the surface all the way round the ellipse. Around the front of the ellipse there is a favourable pressure gradient - i.e. the pressure is pushing in the same direction as the bulk ﬂuid motion. The favourable pressure gradient makes the velocity gradient at the wall steeper. Around the back of the ellipse there is an adverse pressure gradient - i.e. the pressure is pushing in the opposite direction to the bulk ﬂuid motion. The adverse pressure gradient makes the velocity gradient at the wall less steep and eventually will cause ﬂow reversal. 7 This ﬂow reversal completely changes the ﬂow! The reversing ﬂuid has to go somewhere. It cannot reverse all the way to the front of the ellipse because there is a favourable pressure gradient there and all the ﬂuid is moving forwards. Instead it separates from the body at a mini-stagnation point, which is called the point of separation. Ludwig Prandtl was the ﬁrst person to realize this. The ﬁgure below is taken from his 1905 paper. “A ﬂuid layer which is set into rotation by friction at the wall pushes itself out into the free ﬂuid where it causes a complete transformation of the motion.” Here are some examples of separated boundary layers. 8 8.7 Delaying boundary layer separation Under adverse pressure gradients, whether the ﬂow reverses near the wall is de- termined by the competing eﬀects of the pressure gradient and the diﬀusion of momentum from the external ﬂow towards the wall. That momentum diﬀusion is more eﬃcient when the ﬂow is more viscous, so increasing the viscosity can make the ﬂow more robust against separation. momentum diﬀuses from the outer ﬂow more eﬃciently into the boundary layer, which can then withstand the adverse pressure gradient longer In aerodynamics, separation is usually detrimental because it increases drag. However, increasing viscosity (if it were possible) would also increase drag by in- creasing the wall shear stress. It is possible to delay separation in other ways, for example by injecting momentum directly into the boundary layer: injection of high-momentum ﬂuid counteracts ﬂow reversal This is part of the principle behind leading edge slats on wings:1 boundary layer remains attached at higher angles of attack 1Actually, this is not the main reason that leading edge slats are used. The main beneﬁt of slats is that they change the mean ﬂow around the wing. We look at this further in the 3rd year. 9 Another technique to avoid separation is to suck the low momentum part of the boundary layer into the wing: This has been achieved on aeroplanes in ﬂight but requires a great deal of power. In Lecture 9 we will look at a more common way to increase momentum transfer into the boundary layer and hence avoid separation. 10 Engineering Tripos 1B Paper 4 Fluid Mechanics Lecture 9 - Turbulent boundary layers ‹ Reynolds numbers in a boundary layer ‹ Momentum loss ‹ Transition to turbulence ‹ The eﬀect of turbulence ‹ Transition vs. separation ‹ Boundary layer re-attachment Ricardo Garcia-Mayoral r.gmayoral@eng.cam.ac.uk 1 9.1 Recap on laminar boundary layers In Lecture 8 we have studied laminar boundary layers. In these, wall-parallel layers of ﬂuid slide and shear smoothly over each other, like a pack of cards. In this lecture, we will focus on turbulent boundary layers, where viscous dissipation is not suﬃcient to absorb all the energy fed into the ﬂow, which subsequently breaks up in a disorganised way. In a sense, turbulent boundary layers are to their laminar counterparts what turbulent pipe ﬂow is to Poiseuille ﬂow, as we saw in Lecture 6. 9.2 Reynolds numbers in a boundary layer In Lecture 8 we also deﬁned a Reynolds number based on the boundary layer thick- ness, Reδ = ρV δ/µ. However, it is often diﬃcult to determine δ, so alternatively we use the Reynolds number based on the streamwise distance from the beginning of the boundary layer x, Rex = ρV x µ Note that Reδ and Rex have a one-to-one correspondence, as the relationship be- tween δ and x is univocal, δ ∼ √ µ x ρ V ⇒ δ x ∼ 2 9.3 Momentum loss As the boundary layer grows, the ﬂow loses momentum because of the friction shear stress exerted by the wall. The momentum loss can be related to the shear stress by considering a control volume delimited by the streamline that passes through y = δ at the end of the volume: The balance of x-momentum (per unit length into page) gives that the force on the control volume equals the net ﬂux of momentum out, The height h is unknown, but by conservation of mass (per unit length into the page), ˙mout = ˙min, we have We can use this to eliminate h from the momentum equation, obtaining ∫ x 0 τwdx = V ∫ δ 0 ρvdy − ∫ δ 0 ρv2dy. net force on the plate momentum ﬂux in through 1 momentum ﬂux out through 2 The integral on the left gives the total force that the plate exerts on the ﬂuid between 0 and x. On the right hand side, the second term is the ﬂux of momentum when the ﬂow leaves the control volume, and the ﬁrst term is equal to the momentum ﬂux when the ﬂow entered the control volume –except we have managed to express it in ‘exit’ variables. Using this equation, we can work out the friction at the wall if we know the velocity proﬁle v(y). Note that we have made no assumptions on the type of ﬂow, so this works both for laminar and turbulent boundary layers, and could easily be extended to cases with a pressure gradient. 3 Let us use the previous relationship to calculate the growth rate of a bound- ary layer. For example, the velocity proﬁle of a laminar boundary layer is given approximately by v(y) = V [3 2 y δ − 1 2 (y δ )3] . The wall shear stress is then τw = µ dv dy \f \f \f \fy=0 = The momentum ﬂux on entry is equal to V ∫ δ 0 ρvdy = The momentum on leaving the control volume is ∫ δ 0 ρv2dy = Combining all the above we have 3µV 2 x∫ 0 dx δ = 5 8 ρV 2δ − 17 35ρV 2δ = 39 280ρV 2δ ⇒ x∫ 0 dx δ = 13 140 ρV µ δ, and diﬀerentiating with respect to x we ﬁnally obtain 1 δ = 13 140 ρV µ dδ dx ⇒ δ dδ dx = d dx ( δ2 2 ) = 140 13 µ ρV ⇒ δ2 = 280 13 µ ρV x ⇒ δ x = 4.64 √Rex . We can see that, by combining the equation for the momentum loss in a boundary layer with the velocity proﬁle v(y), we can calculate the boundary layer growth δ along x. Note however that this derivation is very sensitive to the velocity gradient at the wall, dv/dy|y=0. 4 9.4 Transition to turbulence in boundary layers We have seen that a Reynolds number compares the relative importance of advec- tive and viscous terms. In a boundary layer, the Reynolds number Rex increases as the ﬂow moves downstream, and the viscous terms become comparatively less and less important. As in pipe ﬂow, at high Rex the viscosity is not able to support the ﬂow shear, and the ﬂow breaks down into smaller and smaller, disorganised eddies, until a scale is reached at which viscosity can act. In the early stages of a boundary layer, Rex is relatively low, the viscous forces are strong enough to dissipate all the energy fed into the ﬂow, and the boundary layer remains laminar. Once Rex is large enough, the boundary layer transitions to turbulence, and remains turbulent thereafter. high Rex ⇒ viscous forces are weak ⇒ ﬂow breaks down into small, disorganised eddies ⇒ turbulence In a very controlled environment, like a wind tunnel with extremely low noise, the transition to turbulence occurs suddenly for a given value of Rex. In most real life applications, however, the transition is less organised, and turbulent spots form irregularly, as in the top view above. Nevertheless, the region over which the ﬂow transitions from laminar to fully turbulent is usually small compared to the length of the boundary layer. 5 9.5 Eﬀect of turbulence on the boundary layer Turbulence increases the rate of momentum transfer between the surface and the free stream, as we discussed in Lecture 6 when we introduced the concept of eddy viscosity. This has three direct eﬀects: the boundary layer grows more quickly, the velocity proﬁle is fuller and the skin friction increases. - faster growth - proﬁle fuller than laminar - gradient at wall steeper ⇒ higher friction The increase in momentum transfer has another very important consequence. In Lecture 8 we saw that the ﬂow inside a boundary layer can reverse direction in the presence of a strong adverse pressure gradient, and that this causes the separation of the boundary layer from the body. Turbulent boundary layer: ⇒ momentum eddy diﬀusion makes proﬁle fuller ⇒ more robust vs. ﬂow reversal ⇒ separation delayed There is a competition between momentum transfer from the free stream, which resists ﬂow reversal, and the adverse pressure gradient, which enhances ﬂow rever- sal. Turbulence increases momentum transfer from the free stream, and therefore it makes the boundary layer more resistant to adverse pressure gradients. laminar boundary layer turbulent boundary layer 6 9.6 Eﬀect of separation on pressure distribution Downstream of separation points, the ﬂow in recirculation regions is usually much quieter than upstream, and can comparatively be considered stationary. The pres- sure distribution on the wall in these regions is then roughly constant, and it’s value is approximately that at the separation point, because the pressure gradient across the separated streamline is ﬁnite. This results in the pressure in the back of ob- stacles not recovering fully to its corresponding high value for the idealised inviscid solution. As a result, a suction force is generated in the wake, giving rise to pressure drag or form drag. inviscid ﬂow: • no boundary layers real viscous ﬂow: • boundary layers separate Given that turbulent boundary layers can delay separation, and thus produce smaller separated regions and wakes behind obstacles, they can mitigate the above lack of pressure recovery. Therefore, an obstacle with turbulent boundary layers will have less form drag than the same obstacle with laminar boundary layers, and triggering turbulence can reduce form drag. This is why golf balls are dimpled. We will examine this further in Lecture 10. laminar boundary layer =⇒ turbulent boundary layer 7 9.7 Comparison of separation and transition to turbulence Boundary layer separation and boundary layer transition to turbulence are entirely diﬀerent phenomena. Nevertheless, transition to turbulence often occurs in bound- ary layers that have just separated, and this can cause some confusion between the two. (a) separation without transition (b) separation immediately followed by transition (c) transition without separation Transition to turbulence rapidly occurs in laminar boundary layers that have just separated, because their velocity proﬁles contain an inﬂexion point (i.e. at which ∂2vx/∂y2 = 0) which makes them inherently unstable. In the presence of adverse pressure gradients, laminar boundary layers are likely to separate, develop an in- ﬂexional proﬁle and immediately transition to turbulence. In the majority of ﬂows, separation causes almost instantaneous transition to turbu- lence, as in ﬁgure (b) above. However, in very viscous separated ﬂow the viscosity is high enough to damp down any perturbations, and the ﬂow remains laminar. This is the case of ﬁgure (a) above. If there is little or no adverse pressure gradi- ent, the boundary layer will become turbulent without undergoing separation, as in ﬁgure (c). 8 9.8 Boundary layer re-attachment When a boundary layer separates and subsequently becomes turbulent, the velocity proﬁle becomes fuller, as corresponds to the enhanced momentum transfer of the new, turbulent state. This new proﬁle may be robust enough to overcome the adverse pressure gradient that had originally produced the separation, so it will not present ﬂow reversal. As a result, the ﬂow will re-attach. The whole process results in a small separation bubble laminar boundary layer + adverse pressure gradient ⇒ Separation bubbles can often be observed at the leading edge of wings at high angle of attack. Aerofoil shapes are often designed to insure that, once separated, the ﬂow transitions to turbulence quickly, so that the separation bubble is short. If the transition occurs too far downstream, the bubble will cover a large area of the wing, or the ﬂow may not even be able to re-attach at all. This can be a very dangerous in-ﬂight situation, because the wing could suddenly stall and lose most of its lift force. 9 Engineering Tripos 1B Paper 4 Fluid Mechanics Lecture 10 - External ﬂows and drag ‹ Forces on solid bodies – lift and drag ‹ External ﬂows at diﬀerent Reynolds numbers ‹ Use and limitations of the inviscid model ‹ Boundary layer separation and drag reduction ‹ Unsteady eﬀects Ricardo Garcia-Mayoral r.gmayoral@eng.cam.ac.uk 1 10.1 Lift and drag When a ﬂuid ﬂows around an object (or the object moves through the ﬂuid) the ﬂow exerts a force on the object. We call these external ﬂows, as opposed to the internal, conﬁned ﬂows which are typical for instance of pipes, and which we studied in Lectures 6 and 7. We are usually interested in the components of the force ex- erted in the direction of the free-stream velocity –the drag– and that perpendicular to it –the lift. In Lecture 5, sections 6 and 8, we saw that these two forces can be expressed in dimensionless form, so that they depend only on a minimum set of dimensionless parameters. CL = Lift 1/2 ρV 2A CD = Drag 1/2 ρV 2A If the ﬂow is incompressible (i.e. at low Mach number) the lift and drag coeﬃcients, CL and CD are functions of the shape of the object, its surface roughness, the angle of attack and the Reynolds number. CL, CD = f (Re, M, α, geometry, ...) In Lectures 8 and 9 we have seen that real ﬂuids with non-zero viscosity produce boundary layers near solid surfaces, and that these generate frictional shear stress. We have also seen that when a ﬂow separates, a low pressure region forms behind the separation point. These two phenomena give rise to two diﬀerent contributions to drag: skin friction and form drag. bluﬀ body: • lower skin friction • higher form drag streamlined body: • higher skin friction • lower form drag When the Reynolds number is suﬃciently large, form drag usually dominates in bluﬀ bodies, while in streamlined bodies form drag is small and most of the drag is due to viscous friction. 2 In the following sections, we will illustrate how friction and pressure drag evolve with the Reynolds number, using the example of the ﬂow around a sphere. In Lecture 5, sections 1 and 5, we introduced the corresponding CD = f (Re) curve, and we will now analyse it in detail. Note that a sphere, because of its symmetry, does not produce a net lift, but this would need to be considered for an asymmetric body. 3 10.2 Flows at very low Reynolds number (Re ≪ 1) When the Reynolds number is vanishingly small, the ﬂow is perfectly attached and does not separate. This implies that there is no form drag, as that caused by ﬂow separation. The velocity increases with the distance from the surface, and the whole ﬂow resembles a very thick boundary layer. The ﬂow around a sphere is governed by Navier-Stokes equations, but at very low Reynolds number, Re ≪ 1, viscous terms dominate over inertial ones, so we have ρ ∂v ∂t + ρv · ∇v = −∇p + µ∇ 2v 4 This type of purely viscous ﬂow is known as Stokes or creeping ﬂow. For the ﬂow around a sphere, the Stokes equations have an analytical solution –as they did for laminar ﬂow between two ﬂat plates in Lecture 4. The solution is vr V = ( 1 − 3 2 [ r R ]−1 + 1 2 [ r R ]−3) cos θ, vθ V = − (1 − 3 4 [ r R ]−1 − 1 4 [ r R ]−3) sin θ, p − p∞ µV /R = − ( 3 2 [ r R ]−2) cos θ. The diﬀerential contributions to the drag can be integrated along the sphere’s surface, and the resulting total drag is 6πµRV . The drag coeﬃcient is therefore CD = drag 1 2ρV 2πR2 = 6πµRV 1 2ρV 2πR2 = Stokes ﬂows are qualitatively very diﬀerent from inviscid ﬂows –the most notable diﬀerence being that they satisfy no-slip at solid surfaces– even if the streamlines appear to be similar. Stokes ﬂows only exist at very small length scales, or for very viscous ﬂows. These conditions are rarely found in everyday life, so we do not have a good sense for such ﬂows, and their behaviour can be somewhat counter-intuitive. 5 10.3 Flows at moderately low Reynolds number (Re ≈ 10-100) In the ﬂow around a sphere at Re ≈ 100, the boundary layer separates just behind the shoulder and a toroidal recirculating region forms. The pressure in the re-circulating region is approximately the same as that at the point of separation, and is lower than the pressure on the corresponding region at the front of the sphere. This is the origin of form drag. On a plot of CD as a function of Re, the total CD increases relative to 24/Re as Re increases. Note that the scale for CD is logarithmic, so seemingly small deviations imply that the actual CD may be several times larger than the Stokes-ﬂow CD. As discussed in Lectures 8 and 9, the point of separation is determined by the competition between the diﬀusion of momentum from the free stream due to viscos- ity, which delays separation, and the adverse pressure gradient at the back of the sphere, which promotes separation. As the Reynolds number increases, the relative importance of viscous eﬀects decreases, and the point of separation moves upstream towards the shoulder. 6 10.4 Flows at moderately high Reynolds number (Re ≈ 103-10 5) As the Reynolds number keeps increasing, the form drag becomes more and more dominant. Beyond a Reynolds number of ≈ 1000, the skin friction is negligible. Between Re ≈ 1000 and Re ≈ 200000, the point of separation remains very near the shoulder, and the drag coeﬃcient remains approximately constant at CD ≈ 0.4. Re = 15, 000, instantaneous image Re = 15, 000, time-averaged image 10.5 Flows at very high Reynolds number (Re ≳ 10 6) At Reynolds numbers above 200000, the boundary layer becomes turbulent before it reaches the shoulder. Turbulence in the boundary layer increases the transport of momentum from the free stream and therefore delays separation. The separation point moves towards the back of the sphere and the size of the wake reduces. As this happens there is a sudden drop in form drag. In the above photos, the wind tunnel could not reach a Reynolds number suﬃciently high to trigger natural transition, so the boundary layer was tripped with a wire to become turbulent. 7 10.6 Use and limitations of inviscid ﬂow models By deﬁnition, inviscid ﬂuids have no viscosity. Consequently, there is perfect slip with a solid boundary and there can be no boundary layers. If there are no boundary layers, there can be no boundary layer separation, even in the presence of very large adverse pressure gradients. inviscid ﬂow: • no boundary layers high-Re ﬂow: • boundary layers separate It is tempting to think of inviscid ﬂow as being the solution when the Reynolds number tends to inﬁnity but this is not the case! Assuming that a ﬂow is invis- cid is only a good approximation if boundary layers (the regions where viscosity counts) are thin and closely attached to the solid surfaces. As soon as a boundary layer separates, the morphology of the external, inviscid-like ﬂow can change com- pletely. Inviscid models therefore only work in regions where the pressure gradients are favourable or nearly zero. However, obtaining the inviscid-ﬂow solution is usually easy, or at least much easier than obtaining the full Navier-Stokes solution, and serves as a ﬁrst approach to determining the real solution. The resulting pressure gradients can be used to estimate where the ﬂow will separate, and in turn it may be possible to include those separated regions to obtain a new inviscid solution in a modiﬁed domain. • inviscid ﬂow solution: • calculate boundary layer growth (and separation): • recalculate inviscid ﬂow 8 10.7 Drag reduction - streamlining Form drag increases in proportion to the cross-sectional area of the separated region behind a body and ρV 2. On the other hand, skin friction increases in proportion to the surface area of the body and µV /δ: skin friction drag form drag Many important applications, like cars, aeroplanes and ships, are at high Reynolds number, so form drag is much larger than skin friction drag. Therefore, the ﬁrst pri- ority is to reduce form drag. This is achieved by delaying separation of the boundary layers, which requires adverse pressure gradients to be as gentle as possible. • bluﬀ body: • streamlined body: Streamlining often has the side-eﬀect of increasing the skin friction drag. However, this is only inﬂuential at low Reynolds number. The drag coeﬃcients for a cylinder and a streamlined strut are shown above (note that CD for a cylinder is generally greater than for a sphere). The streamlined strut has higher CD at low Re, when skin friction drag dominates, but lower CD at high Re, when form drag dominates. 9 10.8 Drag reduction - other methods In Lecture 8 we presented two ways to delay boundary layer separation and reduce form drag: 1. Inject high momentum air into the boundary layer. This works well and is the idea behind slats at the front of air- craft wings for high angle of attack oper- ation. 2. Drain away the layer of slow-moving air at the bottom of the boundary layer by sucking it through small holes in the object. This works well but often requires more power than is saved in reducing form drag. An easier way to reduce form drag is to trigger turbulence in the boundary layer by roughening the surface of the body. This comes of course at the cost of increasing the (now turbulent) skin friction, but the reduction in form drag is typically much larger. 10 10.9 Resonance due to laminar/turbulent transition The sudden reduction of drag for slightly larger velocities due to laminar/turbulent transition in the boundary layer, and the corresponding separation delay, can give rise to a resonance phenomenon. This can sometimes be observed in poles, chim- neys and other slender objects, and needs to be addressed to avoid structural failure. V ′ = velocity of the wind relative to the post If a pole under a uniform free stream is allowed to rock back and forth, its velocity relative to the ﬂow may oscillate enough that the boundary layers are laminar or turbulent at diﬀerent times of the oscillating cycle. When the pole advances against the wind, its velocity is higher, boundary layers are turbulent, the separation region is reduced and form drag is smaller. In turn, when the pole moves back with the wind, its velocity relative to the ﬂow is smaller, boundary layers are laminar, the separation region is increased and form drag is larger. As a result, the rocking motion is enhanced, in a similar fashion as propelling oneself in a swing. 11 10.10 Flow instability and vortex shedding When boundary layers separate, they create a shear layer. Shear layers are inher- ently unstable because they have inﬂexion points in their velocity proﬁles. They develop waves that roll up into Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. There are two approximately-parallel shear layers behind a bluﬀ body such as a cylinder. They feed back on each other and resonate, and the resulting ﬂow is even more unstable than a single shear layer. The shear layers start by snaking up and down together, and soon they roll up into vortices that are shed alternately from each side of the cylinder. This is known as vortex shedding. The vortex shedding frequency, f , is a function of the velocity of the ﬂow, V , and the distance between the shear layers, D. Experimentally one ﬁnds that the Strouhal number, f D/V , is approximately 0.2 at moderate and high Reynolds numbers. Vor- tex shedding also has important consequences for slender structures such as chim- neys, particularly if the frequency of vortex shedding matches the resonant frequency of the structure. 12 Thanks!
