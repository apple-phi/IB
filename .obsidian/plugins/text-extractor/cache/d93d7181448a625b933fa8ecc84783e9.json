We now want to look at the corresponding properties of the Fourier transform See also EI Data book for a fairly complete list of properties. 2 / 27 Properties of the FT Linearity The Fourier Transform is linear, just like the Laplace transform and Fourier series. For a linear function the following result applies: f(t) = af1(t) + bf2(t) FT ←→ aF1(ω) + bF2(ω) = F(ω) (1) where a and b are scalar constants. This is really just saying that integration is a linear operator - can check this result for yourself. This means we can find the Fourier transform of complicated functions by decomposing them as a sum of simpler functions (f(t) = af1(t) + bf2(t)) and then summing the transforms of the simpler functions (F(ω) = aF1(ω) + bF2(ω)). 3 / 27 Properties of the FT Time Scaling / Similarity Theorem If f(t) has Fourier transform F(ω), what is the Fourier transform of f(αt), the time-scaled version of f(t)? Start with the definiton of the inverse FT: f(t) = Now simply substitute αt for t: f(αt) = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ F(ω)ejω(αt)dω For α > 0, substitute ω′ = αω, hence dω = (1/α)dω′ and limits are unchanged: f(αt) = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ ˆ ˙ ejω′tdω′ 4 / 27 Properties of the FT Studying the form of this equation, we can see that it is precisely in the form of an inverse Fourier transform, where the frequency function is 1 α F \u0010 ω′ α \u0011. Hence: f(αt) FT ←→ (2) Thus, if we stretch in the time domain we contract in the frequency domain and vice versa. (This results also holds for α < 0 – you can check this is the case). 5 / 27 Properties of the FT Example Recall the example of the rectangular pulse near the end of Handout 3. The formula for the pulse is given by f(t) = ˆ b for −T/2 < t < T/2 0 otherwise and has Fourier transform: Thus f(2t), which is a pulse of width T/2, will have FT thus producing a spectrum of double the width. 6 / 27 Properties of the FT Heisenberg-Gabor principle We note that increasing α in the time-stretched function makes f(αt) proportionally narrower. However, as α increases, 1 α F \u0000 ω α \u0001 becomes proportionally ‘wider’, and vice versa: In fact there is a general principle, the Heisenberg-Gabor principle, which formalises this idea: If any function f(t) has time duration T, and its Fourier transform F(ω) has frequency bandwidth B, then, This can be proved quite elegantly, but we won’t go into the details here. 7 / 27 Properties of the FT Time Shift If f(t) has FT F(ω), what is the FT of f(t − t0) (time shifted by +t0)? Again, start with the inverse FT formula: f(t) = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ F(ω)e jωtdω Substitute t − t0 for t to give f(t − t0) = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ F(ω)ejω(t−t0)dω = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ \bF(ω)e−jωt0 \t ejωtdω Again, the integral is itself in the form of an inverse FT, so that: f(t − t0) FT ←→ (3) You get to prove this for yourself - see examples paper 6/6 question 4. 8 / 27 Properties of the FT Frequency Shift or Modulation If f(t) has Fourier transform F(ω), what function has Fourier transform F(ω − ω0)? This time, start with forward transform formula and substitute ω − ω0 for ω: F(ω − ω0) = Z ∞ −∞ f(t)e−j(ω−ω0)tdt = Z ∞ −∞ { }e−jωtdt so that e jω0tf(t) FT ←→ F(ω − ω0) (4) This result is fundamental to the modulation of signals (see Communications course - 2nd half of Lent Paper 6). 9 / 27 Properties of the FT From the above modulation theorem we can deduce the FT of f(t) cos(ω0t) in terms of the FT of f(t), since f(t) cos(ω0t) = 1 2 {ejω0tf(t) + e−jω0tf(t)} Hence, by linearity of the FT: f(t) cos(ω0t) FT ←→ (5) 10 / 27 Properties of the FT The main applications of this occur in mobile comms., radio and television, where a harmonic carrier wave (cos ω0t in this case) is multiplied (’modulated’) by an envelope (f(t) - containing the broadcast signal). The result is that the spectrum of the envelope is separated into two parts, each half of its original strength, and shifted along the ω axis by ±ω0. 11 / 27 Properties of the FT Differentiation wrt t If f(t) has Fourier transform F(ω), what is the Fourier transform of df dt ? f′(t) = d dt \u0012 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ F(ω)ejωtdω\u0013 = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ F(ω) d dt \bejωt\t dω = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ { } ejωtdω which therefore tells us that f′(t) FT ←→ (6) Then, it is clear that repeated differentiation will simply bring down further factors of (jω) – which leads to the result f(n)(t) FT ←→ (7) where f(n)(t) denotes the nth derivative of f(t) 12 / 27 Properties of the FT Duality Suppose the Fourier transform of f(t) is g(ω). What is the Fourier transform of g(t) (i.e. the same function g(ω) interpreted as a function of time)? Inverse FT gives: f(t) = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ g(ω)ejωtdω Now, if we replace t in the above by −ω′ and rename ω with t′ (ω is simply an integration variable), we have f(−ω′) = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ g(t′)e−jω′t′dt′ Rearranging this gives: 2πf(−ω′) = Z ∞ −∞ g(t′)e−jω′t′dt′ where the RHS is exactly the FT of g(t′). 13 / 27 Properties of the FT This is a labour-saving result. If we have one Fourier transform pair: f(t) FT ←→ g(ω) then we automatically have (without any integration) the dual Fourier transform pair: g(t) FT ←→ This can be diﬀicult to understand at first read-through. See also Example Sheet 6/6, Q4. 14 / 27 Properties of the FT Example: Saw previously (and it is in the databook) that the Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse centred on the origin (width T, height b) was bTsinc(ωT/2). Hence, by duality, the Fourier transform of bTsinc(tT/2) is a rectangle pulse 15 / 27 Properties of the FT The Multiplication Theorem and Parseval’s Theorem Consider two functions f1(t) and f2(t) with FTs F1(ω) and F2(ω) and look at the integral of the product of f1 and f∗ 2: Z ∞ −∞ f1(t)f∗ 2(t)dt = Z ∞ −∞ f1(t) ˆ 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ F∗ 2(ω)e−jωtdω˙ dt = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ F∗ 2(ω) ˆZ ∞ −∞ f1(t)e−jωtdt˙ dω = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ dω 16 / 27 Properties of the FT Putting f1(t) = f2(t) in the above leads to Parseval’s theorem Z ∞ −∞ |f(t)|2dt = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ |F(ω)|2dω (8) Note the similarity between this and Parseval’s theorem for Fourier series – here it is telling us that the amount of ‘energy’ in a system can be found either by integrating in the time domain or (equivalently) in the spectral domain. 17 / 27 Properties of the FT Parseval’s Theorem: Example Here we find the energy of the sinc function, f(t) = sin(t) t : E = Z ∞ −∞ \f \f \f \f sin(t) t \f \f \f \f 2 dt This is a hard integral directly in the time domain. However, we do know the Fourier Transform of the sinc function as a rectangle pulse: F(ω) = (π, −1 < ω < +1 0, otherwise Thus applying Parseval directly, we have: E = Z ∞ −∞ \f \f \f \f sin(t) t \f \f \f \f 2 dt = 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ |F(ω)|2dω = π2 × 2 2π = π A hard integral has thus been turned into a simple one over a rectangle function in the frequency domain. 18 / 27 Properties of the FT We can apply a simple extension to work out questions like ‘How much energy of the sinc function lies between frequencies ω1 and ω2?’ The answer is then: 1 2π Z −ω1 −ω2 |F(ω)|2dω+ 1 2π Z ω2 ω1 |F(ω)|2dω = 2 × 1 2π Z ω2 ω1 |F(ω)|2dω [last equality applies only for real-valued signals]. Note that we have to include both the positive and negative frequency ranges in the integral to get the solution here. Note that we can express Parseval in terms of Hz frequency via the substitution ω = 2πf, dω = 2πdf: 1 2π Z ∞ −∞ |F(ω)|2dω = Z ∞ −∞ |F(2πf)|2df 19 / 27 Properties of the FT Convolution The convolution of two functions f(t) and g(t) is written as h(t) = f ∗ g and defined by h(t) = f ∗ g = (9) The Convolution Theorem for Fourier transforms is as follows. Suppose f(t) and g(t) have FTs F(ω) and G(ω). Then, If h(t) = f ∗ g =⇒ (10) cf. similar result for Laplace Transforms. 20 / 27 Properties of the FT We now show this. If h(t) = f ∗ g, taking the FT of the convolution gives H(ω) = Z ∞ t=−∞ ˆZ ∞ τ=−∞ f(τ)g(t − τ) dτ˙ e−jωt dt. (11) Change the order of integration and substitute u = t − τ, [ =⇒ dt = du and no change of limits]: H(ω) = Z ∞ −∞ f(τ) \u0014Z ∞ u=−∞ g(u)e−jω(u+τ)du\u0015 dτ = ˆZ ∞ −∞ f(τ)e−jωτdτ˙ ˆZ ∞ −∞ g(u)e−jωudu˙ = F(ω)G(ω). 21 / 27 Properties of the FT Also, by duality (check this this for yourself): FT ←→ F(ω) ∗ G(ω) (12) [This result is actually quite diﬀicult to show by duality - be careful to use the definitions of F() and G() correctly]. Therefore we have the VERY IMPORTANT result that convolution in one domain is equivalent to multiplication in the other domain. 22 / 27 Properties of the FT Fourier Transforms and Linear Systems As with Laplace transforms, the convolution result for Fourier transforms can be used to analyse the effects of a system on an input signal. Have seen examples of convolution with Laplace transforms in Linear Systems – we can do the same thing with Fourier transforms. Let h(t) be the response of a linear system to an impulse δ(t) (the ‘impulse response’). 23 / 27 Properties of the FT Consider an input to this system of x(t). Since it is a linear system the output, y(t), is the convolution x(t) ∗ h(t): y(t) = x(t) ∗ h(t) = Z ∞ −∞ x(τ)h(t − τ)dτ. (13) Therefore from the convolution theorem, the FT of the output is the product of the FTs of x and h Y(ω) = (14) which is the analogue of the result from Laplace transforms – the transfer function H(ω) is the FT of the impulse response and gives the ratio of the FT of the output to the FT of the input. 24 / 27 Properties of the FT Fourier transform vs. Laplace transform Compare the definitions: F(ω) = f(s) = Similarities: the integrand is the same if we set s = jω Differences: the limits of integration are different (although note that sometimes you will see a bilateral Laplace Transform defined which has limits of (−∞, +∞)). However, for a function f(t) that is zero for t < 0, we have that F(ω) = and the two are equivalent (provided both integrals exist). 25 / 27 Properties of the FT In particular, for a causal linear time-invariant system, we can calculate the frequency response in either way, as follows. Suppose the system has impulse response h(t) with the following properties: h(t) = 0, for any t < 0 (causal system) h(t) LT ↔ h(s) (Laplace transform) h(t) FT ↔ H(ω) (Fourier transform) Then the frequency response of the system can be calculated using either Fourier transforms or Laplace transforms since H(ω) = h(jω) = Frequency response . 26 / 27 Properties of the FT Differential equations can often be solved using either Laplace transforms or Fourier transforms • Laplace is better suited to problems with boundary conditions at t = 0, • Fourier better suited to steady state analysis. Note that standard 1A ac circuit theory is a simple application of Fourier transforms and frequency response to a differential equation system. S. Godsill (2023), J.
