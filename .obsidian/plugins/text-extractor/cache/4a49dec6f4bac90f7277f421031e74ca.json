Yield line analysis of plates and slabs 1. Figure 1 shows, in plan view, a ductile plastic plate, with its corners, A and D, resting on simple supports, and edge, BC, fully clamped. The rest of the perimeter is free. The fully plastic moment per unit length is m for all yield lines. Estimate the central point load, W , required to cause collapse: consider, at least, two distinct, simple mechanisms, each symmetrical about the perpendicular bisector of BC. W A D C B a a Figure 1 2. The square reinforced-concrete ﬂoor slab shown in Figure 2 is simply supported on edges, AB and BC; the other two edges are free. The slab reinforcement is uniform and isotropic, and the fully plastic moments of resistance per unit length are m and m ′ in sagging and hogging, respectively. By considering two simple collapse mechanisms, each symmetrical about the diagonal, BD, estimate the uniform pressure, p, over the entire slab at which collapse will occur. What do you infer about the amount of reinforcement needed to resist bending in the two senses?

Edges BC, DE and F A are fully built-in whilst AB, CD and EF are free. The fully plastic moment of resistance per unit length is m for all yield lines. Ignoring self-weight, estimate the magnitude of the central point load, W , to cause collapse. W L AF E D C B Figure 3 Slip line analysis of continua 4. Figure 4 shows, in cross-sectional view, a long rigid strip of breadth b, being pressed into the upper surface of a material, which may be considered to extend indeﬁnitely into the page. The indentation force per unit length along the strip is F . The material yield stress in pure shear is k. Determine the limiting value of F for the assumed circular slip surface, P Q, as a function of the semi-angle, α, subtended by the arc at the centre, C. Hence, ﬁnd the lowest upper bound on F for the family of slip surfaces deﬁned by α. (Note that the height of C above P varies with α.) b/2 b/2 rigid strip rigid-plastic continuum F /unit length α α slip-surface C P Q Figure 4 2/5 CUED 2023-24 - 3- 5.∗ Figure 5 shows, for the strip described in question 4, another mode of indentation based on the relative displacements of ﬁve identical “rigid” triangular blocks; all other material is undisturbed. (a) Estimate the upper bound on the distributed indentation force, F , in terms of the shear yield stress k, strip width b, and triangle height h. Hence, by varying h, ﬁnd the lowest upper bound on F . (b) Plot values of F over the range, 0.2 ≤ (h/b) ≤ 1.0. Note the sensitivity, or otherwise, of F to variations in (h/b). (c) Suggest another pattern of triangular blocks that would enable friction at the strip/material interface to feature in the upper bound calculation. b/2 b h b b/2rigid strip F /unit length Figure 5 6. A trench is to be excavated and its vertical sides temporarily propped by horizontal jacks bearing on opposite sides. The jacks can exert a maximum force of 60 kN and it is proposed to spread their loading into the trench walls through rigid planks, 0.3 m wide and 1.5 m long. The soil is estimated to have an average shear strength of 10 kN/m 2. Use the plane sliding block mechanism shown in Figure 6 to estimate the bearing load, Fp, at collapse for such a plank, neglecting end eﬀects. Comment on the suitability of the size of this plank for the intended purpose.

The moment sign convention is given in the Structures Data Book, and all forces are applied vertically downwards. (a) When a central point load of magnitude, W , is applied, the largest bending moment is M = −W l/4 at the centre of the beam, and the bending moment diagram is piecewise linear. (b) When a point load of magnitude, W , is applied at a distance, a, from a support, the largest bending moment is M = −W a(l − a)/l at the point where the load is applied, and the bending moment diagram is piecewise linear. (c) When a distributed load of magnitude, w per unit length, is applied to the entire beam, the bending moment at a distance, x, from a support is M = −wx(l−x)/2, and the largest bending moment is M = −wl2/8. (d) When a clockwise couple, C, is applied at the left hand support, the bending moment at a distance, x, from the other support is M = −Cx/l. 8.† Find an optimal lower bound for the collapse load, Wc, of the propped cantilever shown in Figure 7.

It will be made from Grade 43 steel (σy = 245 N/mm 2). (a) If the structure is to be made from a single continuous beam, choose a suitable Universal Beam (UB) from the Structures Data Book.

It is to carry the given loads without failing. Show that a design with fully plastic moments of 38.3 kNm for AB, 25.0 kNm for BE, and 38.3 kNm for EF would be suitable. (b) The same loads are to be carried by the revised design shown in Figure 10(b), where the joints between beams have been moved to C and D, 0.5 m from the interior supports.
