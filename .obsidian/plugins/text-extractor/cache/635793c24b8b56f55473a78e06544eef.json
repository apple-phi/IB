We will focus from now on complex Fourier series, as they are the basis for Fourier Transforms and Discrete Fourier Transforms in later parts of the course. 4 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Proof of expression for coeﬀicients You should be familiar with how to prove the above expressions for coeﬀicients from 1a. The method of proof is important though for development of Fourier Transforms later on, so we reiterate it here. Take the complex case, for example. Multiply g(t) in equation (4) by e−jmt and integrate wrt t from −π to π: I = Z π −π g(t)e−jmtdt = Z π −π ∞ ∑ n=−∞ cne j(n−m)tdt [From Eq.(4)] = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ Z π −π cne j(n−m)tdt [Swap order of int. and summ.] = Z π −π cmdt + ∞ ∑ n=−∞ n̸=m Z π −π cne j(n−m)tdt [Separate out term n = m] 5 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation = 2πcm + ∞ ∑ n=−∞ n̸=m cn Z π −π e j(n−m)tdt = 2πcm + ∞ ∑ n=−∞ n̸=m cn Z π −π cos((n − m)t) + j sin((n − m)t)dt = 2πcm since Z π −π cos(kt)dt = Z π −π sin(kt)dt = 0 when k is an integer not equal to 0. 6 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation We therefore have an expression for the complex Fourier coeﬀicients cn; cn = 1 2π Z π −π g(t)e−jntdt. (6) You can prove the formulae for an and bn by a similar procedure, but multiplying by cos(mt) and sin(mt) instead of exp(imt). 7 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Relationship between real and complex coeﬀicients By splitting Eq. (6) into real and imaginary parts we see that 2cn = 1 π Z π −π g(t) cos(nt)dt − j 1 π Z π −π g(t) sin(nt)dt = an − jbn for n ≥ 0 (with b0 = 0).We therefore have the relationship between the complex and real Fourier coeﬀicients (for g(t) real): 2cn = an − jbn , 2c∗ n = an + jbn for n ≥ 0 (7) and conversely by solving for an and bn: an = c∗ n + cn , jbn = c∗ n − cn for n ≥ 0 (8) From Eq. (6) we can see that c−n = c∗ n and therefore (Eq. (7)): 2c−n = an + jbn , 2c∗ −n = an − jbn for n > 0 Finally the modulus of cn is easily obtained in terms of the real coeﬀicients: 2|cn| = qa2 n + b2 n 8 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Signals with period T T/2−T/2 α T + α When a periodic signal has period T rather than 2π, simply think of ‘stretching’ the time axis by a factor of T/2π. The complex Fourier series, for example, becomes: g(t) = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ cnejnωot. (9) where ωo = 2π T - known as the ‘fundamental frequency’. 9 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation To obtain the formula for the coeﬀicients, substitute 2πt/T = ω0t for t into the coeﬀicient formulae: cn = 1 T Z T/2 −T/2 g(t)e−jωontdt (10) As usual, we can redefine the range of integration to be any whole period of g(t), e.g. α to α + T: cn = 1 T Z α+T α g(t)e−jωontdt (11) 10 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Further Properties of Fourier Series Scaling, stretching and shifting Now consider modifying g(t) by scaling the amplitude by a factor of a, shifting it along the axis by b and changing the period to T′ = βT. What is the modified Fourier series? We can write the modified signal as: g′(t) = ag \u0012 t − b β \u0013 (12) 11 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation The Fourier series is hence g′(t) = ag \u0012 t − b β \u0013 = a ∞ ∑ n=−∞ cne jωon (t−b) β = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ nacne− jωonb β o e jωont β = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ c′ nejω′ ont where the new coeﬀicients and fundamental frequency are: c′ n = acne−jω′ onb ω′ 0 = ω0/β (13) Note the effects of these actions on the frequency components. 12 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Example: Square Wave: Consider the square wave periodic function, amplitude 1, period T = 1; 0 1 2 1 −1 Write down the Fourier series of this square wave and using this, obtain the Fourier series of the modified square wave having amplitude a, period T′ = βT, and shifted along the time axis by b: 0 b b + βT a −a 13 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation The original periodic square wave can be written as the following Fourier series (see Data Book) g(t) = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ n odd 2 jπn e jωont ωo = 2π T . Using our previous result gives directly the new Fourier coeﬀicients: c′ n = 2a jπn e−jω′ 0nb for n odd where ω′ 0 = ω0/β. 14 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Differentiation and Integration If we know the Fourier series representation of a function g(t) then it is relatively straightforward to find the Fourier series for dg(t) dt and R g(t)dt. Suppose g(t) = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ cnejnωot. (14) Then, differentiating gives us dg(t) dt = ∞ ∑ n=−∞(jnωocn)ejnωot = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ c′ nejnωot where c′ n = jnωocn. (15) 15 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Now, suppose dh(t) dt = g(t). Integrate g(t) directly to find h(t): h(t) = Z g(t)dt = c0t + ∞ ∑ n=−∞ n̸=0 cn (jnωo) e jnωot + k (16) We can see that this contains a linear ramp term c0t, and so the integral can only be a Fourier series when c0 = 0, i.e. g(t) has zero mean. To determine the constant of integration k, use standard Fourier series formula for h(t) and n = 0. Thus the coeﬀicients dn for h(t) are: dn = 8 >< >: cn jnωo if n ̸= 0 1 T R T 0 h(t)dt if n = 0 16 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Example Consider the following waveform, g(t), with height T/2 and period T We wish to find the Fourier series expansion for g(t) via use of one of the standard series on the data sheet. 17 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation We look to see if the signal is related to one of our standard signals by differentiation or integration; in this case it is clear that dg(t) dt = f(t), where f(t) is the square wave of amplitude 1 and period T, as shown in the figure. We know from the data sheet that the Fourier series for f(t) is f(t) = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ n odd 2 jπn e jnωot (ω0 = 2π/T). From the above we have the Fourier series for g(t): cn = 8 >< >: 2 jπn 1 jnωo = − T π2n2 n ̸= 0, n odd 1 T R T 0 g(t)dt = T 4 n = 0 Can check this from series for triangular wave (need to shift, scale etc.) in the data book. See now Ex. Paper 6-6 Qqs. 1-2 18 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Interpretation of Fourier Coeﬀicients Consider the complex Fourier series for a periodic signal g(t): g(t) = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ cnejnωot. (17) Each complex exponential ejnωot can be regarded as a pure frequency component of the signal - an oscillating signal containing only sines and cosines with frequency nωot. The component with frequency ωo is known as the fundamental frequency, or first harmonic, 2ωo is the second harmonic, ..., nωo is the nth harmonic. 19 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation We can represent this frequency content graphically: |c0| |c1| |c1| |c2| 20 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation The amplitudes r0, r1, ...,rn of the harmonics are defined by rewriting the real Fourier series for g(t) in terms of a d.c. term plus pure sine waves: a0 2 + ∞ ∑ n=1{an cos(nω0t) + bn sin(nω0t)} = r0 + ∞ ∑ n=1 rn sin(nω0t + ϕn) so that r0 = a0/2 and rn = p(a2 n + b2 n) by standard trigonometric identities. From equation (7) we can therefore express this amplitude in terms of the cn’s, for n ≥ 1: rn = q(a2 n + b2 n) = 2|cn| ≡ |c−n| + |cn|. [i.e. rn contains both the negative and positive frequency components of cn] and, for n = 0, the DC component, r0 = a0/2 = c0 You need this result for Ex. Paper 6/6 Q.3 !. 21 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation These amplitudes can be related to the power content of the signal g(t) over one period (or the average energy over one period). The following expression holds 1 T Z T 0 |g(t)|2dt = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ |cn|2 (18) This is Parseval’s Theorem for Fourier series (we will come across Parseval’s Theorem again later) .... you will show a more general version of this on the example sheet 6/6 Q.7 . 22 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Example As a final example dealing with Fourier series we will look at passing a periodic signal through a filter and interpreting the effect of the filter by its action on the harmonics. Consider a square wave of period T = 2π and amplitude 1 which is fed into an RC circuit given below Question: Determine the amplitudes of the harmonics of the output waveform vo. 23 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Plan of Solution: Summary of approach: 1. Obtain Fourier series for Vi → cn. 2. Find frequency response of RC-circuit H(jω) = H(s)|s=jω 3. Determine amplitude of nth harmonic at output as 2|cn| × |H(jnωo)| 24 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation Detailed solution: 1. Find Fourier expansion of input From the EI data book we know that the Fourier series expansion for the input square wave, Vi, is Vi = ∞ ∑ n=−∞ n odd 2 jπn e jnωot, ωo = 2π T = 1 Using the definition of harmonic amplitudes, the amplitude of the nth harmonic is thus: rn = 2|cn| = 4 nπ , n = 1, 3, 5, ... The d.c. amplitude r0 is zero. Since the square wave is an odd function we have: g(t) = ∞ ∑ n=1,3,5,... 4 nπ sin(nω0t) 25 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation 2. Find frequency response of the RC-circuit Since I = (Vi − Vo)/R = C dV0 dt we can take Laplace transforms to give Vi − Vo = RCsVo =⇒ Vo Vi = 1 1 + sRC . We replace s by jω to obtain the frequency response: H(jω) = 1 1 + jωRC Recall also that if the input signal to a linear system is a sine wave sin(ωt + θ) and the frequency response is H(jω) ≡ |H(jω)| exp(j arg(H(jω))), then the output signal (after initial transients have died out) is, |H(jω)| sin(ωt + θ + arg(H(jω))) 26 / 28 Revision Further Properties Interpretation 3.

As RC increases, the amplitudes of the harmonics are more attenuated and the waveform has the characteristic exponential rise-and-fall form expected of this circuit (‘low-pass filter’).
