They relate signals around the loop (such as the plant input and output) to external signals injected into the loop (such as reference signals, disturbances and noise signals). It is possible to infer much about the behaviour of the feedback system from consideration of the Return Ratio alone. The aim of using feedback is for the plant output y(t) to follow the reference signal r(t) in the presence of uncertainty. A persistent diﬀerence between the reference signal and the plant output is called a steady state error. Steady-state errors can be evaluated using the ﬁnal value theorem. Many simple control problems can be solved using combinations of proportional, derivative and integral action: Proportional action is the basic type of feedback control, but it can be diﬃcult to achieve good damping and small errors simultaneously. Derivative action can often be used to improve damping of the closed-loop system. Integral action can often be used to reduce steady-state errors. 2 Contents 5 An Introduction to Feedback Control Systems 1 5.1 Open-Loop Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 5.2 Closed-Loop Control (Feedback Control) . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 5.2.1 Derivation of the closed-loop transfer functions: . . . . 5 5.2.2 The Closed-Loop Characteristic Equation . . . . . . . . . 6 5.2.3 What if there are more than two blocks? . . . . . . . . 7 5.2.4 A note on the Return Ratio . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 5.2.5 Sensitivity and Complementary Sensitivity . . . . . . . . 9 5.3 Summary of notation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 5.4 The Final Value Theorem (revisited) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 5.4.1 The “steady state” response – summary . . . . . . . . . 12 5.5 Some simple controller structures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 5.5.1 Introduction – steady-state errors . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 5.5.2 Proportional Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 5.5.3 Proportional + Derivative (PD) Control . . . . . . . . 17 5.5.4 Proportional + Integral (PI) Control . . . . . . . . . . 18 5.5.5 Proportional + Integral + Derivative (PID) Control . . 21 3 5.1 Open-Loop Control “Plant” G(s) Controller K(s) ¯r(s) Demanded Output (Reference) ¯y(s) Controlled Output In principle By open-loop control we refer to the case where we aim to control the output of a system without feedback. As explained on the left this will not work in practice since even small disturbances and model uncertainty will cause the output to de- viate from its desired value (like trying to drive a car with your eyes closed!). 4 5.2 Closed-Loop Control (Feedback Control) For Example: The block diagram on the left illustrates a typical feedback control conﬁguration. The aim is for the controlled output ¯y(s) to follow a refer- ence signal ¯r(s). The plant G(s) is the system we would like to control, and K(s) is the controller that needs to be designed. Disturbances acting at the output and input of the plant are also considered, corresponding to measurement and actuation noise, re- spectively. The transfer func- tions from ¯d0, ¯di, ¯r, ¯e, respectively, to the output ¯y are calculated. These are referred to as closed-loop transfer functions to empha- size the fact that we are in a closed-loop conﬁguration. 5 Also: ¯e(s) = ¯r(s) − ¯y(s) = − 1 The equation 1 + G(s)K(s) = 0 is referred to as the Closed-Loop Char- acteristic Equation. Its solutions give the location of the poles in the closed loop transfer functions. As discussed in the pre- vious handout, the lo- cation of the poles are very important for the behaviour of a system as they determine its stability properties, and also its transient re- sponse. 6 5.2.3 What if there are more than two blocks? For Example: The diagram on the left illustrates a feed- back conﬁguration where in addition to K(s) and G(s), there is an additional transfer function H(s). The latter could be part of the implementation of the control policy or could include the sensor dynamics. The closed-loop transfer functions derived on the left illustrate that the denominator has a form analogous to that when only K(s) and G(s) were present; i.e. the closed loop poles are the solutions to the equation 1 + L(s) = 0 where L(s) is the product of all the transfer functions round the loop (not including the −1 at the summing junction). 7 5.2.4 A note on the Return Ratio G(s)K(s) H(s) Σ − ¯b(s) Σ + 0 Σ + 0 + 0 ¯e(s) + + ¯y(s) ¯a(s) Figure 5.3 With the switch in the position shown (i.e. open), the loop is open. We then have ¯a(s) = H(s)G(s)K(s) × −¯b(s) = −H(s)G(s)K(s)¯b(s) Formally, the Return Ratio of a loop is deﬁned as −1 times the product of all the terms around the loop. In this case L(s) = −1 × −H(s)G(s)K(s) = H(s)G(s)K(s) Feedback control systems are often tested in this conﬁguration as a ﬁnal check before “closing the loop” (i.e. ﬂicking the switch to the closed position). Note: In general, the block denoted here as H(s) could include ﬁlters and other elements of the controller in addition to the sensor dynamics. Furthermore, the block labelled K(s) could include actuator dynamics in addition to the remainder of the designed dynamics of the controller. 88 5.2.5 Sensitivity and Complementary Sensitivity The Sensitivity and Complementary Sensitivity are two particularly important closed-loop transfer functions. The following ﬁgure depicts just one conﬁguration in which they appear. G(s)K(s)Σ Σ + ¯do(s) +¯r(s) ¯e(s) ¯u(s) + ¯y(s) − Figure 5.4 ( L(s) = G(s)K(s) ) ¯y(s) = G(s)K(s) The Sensitivity S(s) and Complementary Sensitivity T (s) are deﬁned, respectively, as S(s) = 1 1 + L(s) T (s) = L(s) 1 + L(s) where L(s) is the return ratio. The block diagram on the left illustrates a conﬁguration where they appear as par- ticular closed-loop transfer functions. Note that the sum- mation of S(s) and T (s) is always equal to 1 irrespective of the form of L(s). 9 5.3 Summary of notation The system being controlled is often called the “plant”. The control law is often called the “controller”; sometimes it is called the “compensator” or “phase compensator”. The “demand” signal is often called the “reference” signal or “command”, or (in the process industries) the “set-point”. The “Return Ratio”, the “Loop transfer function” always refer to the transfer function of the opened loop, that is the product of all the transfer functions appearing in a standard negative feedback loop (our L(s)). Figure 5.1 has L(s) = G(s)K(s), Figure 5.2 has L(s) = H(s)G(s)K(s). The “Sensitivity function” is the transfer function S(s) = 1 10 5.4 The Final Value Theorem (revisited) Consider an asymptotically stable system with impulse response g(t) and transfer function G(s), i.e. g(t) |{z} Impulse response ⇀↽ G(s) | 11 5.4.1 The “steady state” response – summary The term “steady-state response” means two diﬀerent things, depending on the input. Given an asymptotically stable system with transfer function G(s): The steady-state response of the system to a step input that is equal to U for t ≥ 0, is a constant G(0)U . The steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input cos(ωt) is the sinusoid |G(jω)| cos (ωt + arg G(jω)) . These two statements are not entirely unrelated, of course: The steady-state gain of a system to a step input, G(0), is the same as the frequency response evaluated at ω = 0 (i.e. the DC gain). 1212 5.5 Some simple controller structures 5.5.1 Introduction – steady-state errors G(s)K(s)Σ +¯r ¯e ¯u ¯y − Return Ratio: L(s) = G(s)K(s). CLTFs: ¯y(s) = L(s) 13 5.5.2 Proportional Control K(s) = kp G(s)kpΣ +¯r ¯e ¯u ¯y − Typical result of increasing the gain kp, (for control systems where G(s) is itself stable): Increased accuracy of control. “good” Increased control action. Reduced damping. Possible loss of closed-loop stability for large kp. } “bad” Example: G(s) = 1 Proportional Control is the simplest con- trol policy where the controller is just a multiplication with a constant kp. As discussed on the left and in the next page there are tradeoﬀs asso- ciated with the choice of kp. A large kp leads a smaller steady-state error, but this is at the expense of a more oscil- latory response (or even possibly instability). It will be seen later in this handout and also in handouts 6 and 7, that more advanced controllers can better manage these tradeoﬀs. A diagram that shows the closed-loop poles as parameter kp changes is called a root locus dia- gram. 14 Steady-state errors using the ﬁnal value theorem: ¯y(s) = kp 15 For reference, the step response: (i.e. response to ¯r(s) = 1 16 5.5.3 Proportional + Derivative (PD) Control K(s) = kp + kd s In this case, in addition to the multiplication of the input to the controller with a con- stant gain kp, we have the addition of a term where the input to the controller is diﬀerenti- ated and multiplied by a constant kd. As with proportional control there are trade- oﬀs associated with the choice of the gain kd within the derivative term. In particu- lar, increasing kd makes the response less oscil- latory, but this is at the expense of amplify- ing noise. 17 5.5.4 Proportional + Integral (PI) Control In the absence of disturbances, and for our simple conﬁguration, ¯e(s) = 1 18 ¯y(s) = K(s)G(s) 19 PI control – General Case The presence of an inte- grator in the controller, ensures that there is no steady-state error if the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. This follows by contra- diction. In particular, if the error e(t) tends to a constant value that is non-zero, the output of the integrator would tend to inﬁnity, which contradicts the asymp- totic stability of the sys- tem. 20 5.5.5 Proportional + Integral + Derivative (PID) Control K(s) = kp + ki A PID controller can combine the advan- tages of derivative and integral action. Ap- propriate tuning of the controller parameters is though important. Systematic methods for designing such dynamic controllers will be dis- cussed towards the end of the course. 21","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
