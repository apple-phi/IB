Internal flows-hydrodynamics, contd. • Eventually the boundary layer fills the total volume of the pipe. • Farther downstream of this point, the velocity profile remains unchanged. • The flow is called hydrodynamically fully developed. • In a hydrodynamically fully developed flow 𝑢 ≠ 𝑢 𝑥 and the velocity only changes transversally. • Hydrodynamics of internal flows are characterised by the value of Reynolds number: 𝑅𝑒 = 𝑉𝐷 𝜈 , where D is the pipe diameter. Turbulent and laminar flows • Flow inside a pipe can be laminar or turbulent, this property of the flow significantly affects the heat transfer rate. • If 𝑅𝑒𝐷 ≤ 2300 the pipe flow is laminar, (this Re number is called the critical Reynolds number) • For greater Reynolds numbers, flow is not completely laminar and shows some turbulent features. For large enough Reynolds numbers (𝑅𝑒𝐷 ≈ 10000) it will be fully turbulent. • The length of the entrance region depends upon the state of the flow (laminar or turbulent and the Reynolds number). • For laminar flows ( 𝑥𝑓𝑑,ℎ 𝐷 ) ≈ 0.05𝑅𝑒𝐷, where 𝑥𝑓𝑑,ℎ is the minimum length of the pipe downstream of that the flow is hydrodynamically fully developed (or the length of entrance region). • For turbulent flows 10 ≤ ( 𝑥𝑓𝑑,ℎ 𝐷 ) ≤ 60. Schematic illustration of laminar and turbulent pipe flows 𝑥𝑓𝑑,ℎ or Velocity considerations • Since velocity changes over the cross section, an area averaged velocity should be defined: 𝑚 = 𝜌𝑢𝑚𝐴𝑐, where 𝑚 is the mass flow rate of the fluid (kg/s), 𝜌 is the density of fluid (kg/𝑚3), 𝐴𝑐 is the cross sectional area of the pipe (𝑚2), and 𝑢𝑚 is the average velocity. • Since 𝑚= 𝐴𝑐 𝜌𝑢 𝑟, 𝑥 𝑑𝐴𝑐, it follows that for an incompressible flow (that is a flow with constant density) in a circular tube: 𝑢𝑚 = 𝐴𝑐 𝜌𝑢 𝑟, 𝑥 𝑑𝐴𝑐 𝜌𝐴𝑐 = 2𝜋𝜌 𝜌𝜋𝑅2 0 𝑅 𝑢 𝑟, 𝑥 𝑟𝑑𝑟 = 2 𝑅2 0 𝑅 𝑢 𝑟, 𝑥 𝑟𝑑𝑟 • This expression may be used to determine 𝑢𝑚 at any axial location x from the knowledge of the velocity profile at that location.

From conservation of mass 𝜕𝜈 𝜕𝑦=0, and therefore 𝑣 = 0. • In the fully developed region, velocity field has only one axial component which remains unchanged along the pipe. • Consider flow in a cylinder of radius r, momentum conservation: 𝜋𝑟2𝑑𝑝 − 2𝜋𝑟𝑑𝑥𝜏 = 0, 𝜏 = 𝜇 𝑑𝑢 𝑑𝑟 • Combining these two gives: 𝑑𝑢 = 𝑟 2𝜇 ( 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑥)𝑑𝑟 𝑢 𝑟 = 𝑟2 4𝜇 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑥 +𝐶1. 6 Illustration of the forces acting on an element of fluid in a pipe flow Flow direction • The condition of no-slip velocity at the wall yields (𝑢𝑦=𝑅=0) 𝑢 𝑟 = 1 4𝜇 ( 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑥)(𝑟2 − 𝑅2). • Now the mass flow rate is 𝑚=2𝜋𝜌 0 𝑅 𝑟𝑢 𝑟 𝑑𝑟, • We defined the bulk flow velocity as 𝑈𝑚 = 𝑚 𝜌𝐴𝑐. Thus: 𝑈𝑚 = 𝑚 𝜌𝐴𝑐 = − 𝑅2 8𝜇 ( 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑥) 𝑢(𝑟) 𝑈𝑚 = 2 1 − (𝑟 𝑅)2 . • 𝜏𝑠 = 𝜇( 𝑑𝑢 𝑑𝑟) 𝑟=𝑅 = 8𝜇𝑈𝑚 𝐷 and therefore, the skin friction coefficient for the pipe flow, 𝐶𝑓, which is also known as Fanning friction coefficient is 𝐶𝑓 = 2𝜏𝑠 𝜌𝑈𝑚 2 = 16 𝑅𝑒𝐷 , 7 Friction factor in fully developed flow • Pressure drop in pipe flow is a very important engineering issue, o increases the pumping power, o increases the required energy and cost of the process. • To evaluate this, a friction factor is often used. This is a dimensionless parameter defined as 𝑓 ≡ − 𝑑𝑃 𝑑𝑥 𝐷 𝜌𝑢𝑚 2 /2 • Note that, friction factor is different to friction coefficient defined as 𝐶𝑓 = 2𝜏𝑠 𝜌𝑈𝑚 2 • Since 𝜏𝑠 = 𝜇( 𝑑𝑢 𝑑𝑟) 𝑟=𝑅 we can show that 𝐶𝑓 = 𝑓 4. • For fully developed laminar flow: 𝑓 = 64 𝑅𝑒𝐷 (derive this relation!) Water pumps used in a power station. Friction losses have a strong impact upon the electricity that these pumps consume. • For turbulent flows the analysis is much more complicated and empirical results are frequently used (Moody diagram). • Note that in practice pressure drop is dominated by the Reynolds number and surface roughness of the pipe. Thermal considerations 10 • If the pipe surface temperature is different to that of the fluid then a thermal boundary layer develops. • Similar to velocity boundary layer, the thermal boundary layers grow and eventually meet. • This leads to the formation of a thermally fully developed region. • Note that the surface of the pipe can be under constant temperature or constant heat flux. • The shape of the temperature profile in the fully developed region depends upon the relative temperature of the duct and fluid. • For laminar flow: ( 𝑥𝑓𝑑,𝑡 𝐷 )𝑙𝑎𝑚≈ 0.05𝑅𝑒𝐷𝑃𝑟 • Similar to velocity, the temperature field varies across the pipe cross section. • An average temperature is defined on the basis of the total thermal energy transported. • The rate of internal energy transported: 𝐸𝑡 = 𝐴𝑐 𝜌𝑢𝑐𝑣𝑇𝑑𝐴𝑐. • If the mean temperature is defined such that 𝐸𝑡 = 𝑚𝑐𝑣𝑇𝑚 then, 𝑇𝑚 = 2 𝑢𝑚𝑟0 2 0 𝑟0 𝑢𝑇𝑟𝑑𝑟. • If the surface temperature of the pipe is 𝑇𝑠 then the local heat flux is 𝑞′′ = ℎ(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑚) (note that 𝑞′′ = 𝑞/A), where h is the local convection coefficient and 𝑇𝑠 is the local temperate of the pipe surface. • Note that 𝑇𝑚 is never a constant and varies along the pipe, why?","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
