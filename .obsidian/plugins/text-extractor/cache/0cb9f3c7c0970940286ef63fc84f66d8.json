Why do we need to know about heat transfer? Simply because it is very difficult to find an industry in which heat transfer does not matter! 3 Oil and gas Aerospace Automotive Electronics manufacturing Renewable energy Textbook for this course To study more about the fundamentals of heat convection and also for further practice, the following textbooks are highly recommended. 1- T. Bergman, A. S. Lavine, F. P. Incropera, D. P. Dewitt, Introduction to heat transfer or (Fundamentals of heat and mass transfer), Sixth edition, 2011, John Wiley & Sons, New York. 2- J. P. Holman, Heat Transfer, tenth edition, 2009, McGraw-Hill, New York. Please note that earlier versions of these books are equally useful. Apart from these two famous textbooks any textbook on heat transfer covers the materials presented in the heat convection lectures. 4 Structure of this course • Part I: heat conduction & radiation (Dr Dobson’s part) • Part II: heat convection and heat exchangers – 9 lectures – One review lecture and exam preparation session – Two tutorials and one lab – The two parts of this course are highly connected 5 Principal mechanisms of heat transfer • Heat always travels from hot to cold place (second law of thermodynamics) • Hot means higher temperature • Cold means lower temperature • There are three mechanisms of heat transfer: 1. Heat conduction: happens in solids and fluids and is due to random molecular motion. 2. Heat convection: happens in fluids only and is mainly due to the motion of a fluid. 3. Radiation: happens in everywhere (including vacuum) and has an electromagnetic nature. In this part of the course we are concerned with convection. 6 Conduction • When there is a temperature difference in a solid (or fluid) heat is conducted from high temperature region to low temperature region. • Mathematically, 𝑞 = −𝑘𝐴 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑥 where 𝑘: the thermal conductivity of the material [W/m.K] 𝑞: heat transfer rate [W] 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑥: temperature gradient [K/m] A: the surface area across which heat is being transferred [𝑚2] • Note that thermal conductivity is a thermo-physical property of the material, meaning that as soon as the material type and its temperature are known, the thermal conductivity can be found in tables. (find these tables at the back of your textbook) 7 Convection • If a moving fluid is in contact with a solid or fluid at a different temperature, heat is convected by the moving fluid. • Note that conduction still exists but usually in moving fluids convection is much stronger than conduction. • If 𝑇𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑 > 𝑇𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑 then heat is transferred from solid to fluid if 𝑇𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑 < 𝑇𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑 then heat goes from fluid to solid. • Mathematically 𝒒 = 𝒉𝑨∆𝑻 (Newton’s law of cooling) where – 𝑞: rate of heat transfer [W] – ℎ: convection coefficient [W/𝑚2.K] – 𝐴: the area over which heat is transferred [𝑚2] – ∆𝑇: is temperature difference between the solid surface and the fluid (i.e. 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇∞) 8 Heat convection from a hot surface • Convection coefficient is not a thermo-physical property of the fluid. It depends on the thermo-physical properties of the fluid and also the nature of the fluid flow. 9 Flow of air Convection of heat • Blowing stronger will result in feeling colder on her palm • Blowing stronger higher velocity of air higher convection coefficient higher heat transfer rate from her palm to air feeling colder Heat transfer song! 10 Velocity boundary layer • Consider the following configuration – A uniform flow with constant velocity and temperature flows over a flat surface – The fluid is viscous. (there is friction between the fluid layers) 𝑇∞, 𝑢∞ • The first row of molecules sticks to the solid surface (viscosity) 𝑢𝑦=0=0. • Friction between the first and second rows: retardation (loss of momentum) • Friction between the third and second rows: less retardation • Other layers get similarly retarded. • At d (boundary layer thickness) 𝑢 𝑢∞=0.99. Temperature profile Velocity profile Stationary layer Retarded layer y x d 11 Velocity boundary layer • Inside the boundary layer, viscosity effects are very significant. • There is a large velocity gradient within the boundary layer. • Viscous stress: 𝜏 = 𝜇 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝑦 , in dimensionless from: 𝐶𝑓= 𝜏 1/2𝜌𝑢∞ 2 (skin friction coefficient) • No velocity gradient outside the boundary layer no shear stress • As the molecules get retarded more fluid penetrates into the BL and so boundary layer thickness increases along the surface. 𝑇∞, 𝑢∞ Strong viscous effects No viscous effects t ` 12 x y • Two distinctive regions in the flow – Viscous flow inside the boundary layer – Effectively non-viscous incompressible flow outside the boundary layer – Bernoulli equation holds outside the boundary layer • We need to know the velocity distribution and shear stress inside the boundary layer. 13 Thermal boundary layer • The stationary layer of molecules takes the wall temperature (thermal equilibrium). • Conduction between the retarded fluid layers • Strong temperature gradients inside the thermal boundary layer, • 𝑇𝑠−𝑇 𝑇𝑠−𝑇∞ = 0.99 at the edge of the thermal boundary layer (𝛿𝑡) • Similar to velocity boundary layer thermal boundary layer thickness grows along the wall.

It is essential to determine if the flow under investigation is laminar or turbulent. 18 Nusselt number • Newton’s law of cooling 𝑞 =hA(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇∞) where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient. • Conduction heat flux in the stationary layer 𝑞 = −𝑘𝑓𝐴 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑌 at y=0 • Combining the two: ℎ = −𝑘𝑓𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑦 𝑇𝑠−𝑇∞. • The problem of heat convection is mostly about finding the value of h. • The dimensionless coefficient of convection is called Nusselt number and, is defined as 𝑵𝒖 = 𝒉.𝑳 𝒌𝒇 in which, o h is coefficient of convection, o L is the characteristic length defined according to the problem configuration. o 𝑘𝑓 is the thermal conductivity of fluid. Ernst Kraft Wilhelm Nußelt, 1882-1957. Nusselt number correlations • Calculation of Nusselt number often requires applying advanced computational techniques to solve the governing equation of fluid flow and heat transfer. This, although possible, is quite involved. • We can, however, show analytically (Nusselt did this for the first time) that in forced convection 𝑁𝑢 = 𝑁𝑢 𝑅𝑒, 𝑃𝑟 , where Re is the flow Reynold number defined as Re= 𝑈.𝐿 𝜈 . Pr is the Prandtl number defined as 𝑃𝑟 = 𝜈 𝛼, where 𝜈 is the kinematic viscosity and 𝛼 is the thermal diffusivity, 𝛼 = 𝑘𝑓 𝜌𝐶𝑝 of the fluid. • Note that Pr number is a thermo-physical property of the fluid and Re number is a characteristic of the flow. • Since 𝑁𝑢 = 𝑁𝑢(𝑅𝑒, 𝑃𝑟) experimental studies can be conducted on various flow configurations and heat transferring flows to find empirical correlations for Nusselt number.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
