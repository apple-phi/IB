Therefore, this is a different subject from Thermodynamics, which is only concerned with equilibrium states. Thermodynamics tells about what will happen after a certain quantity of heat is transferred, but not how long the transfer will take. Despite this, “introductory” Heat Transfer is often taught within a Thermodynamics course, and we follow this custom here. There are three mechanisms of heat transfer:-  Conduction – transfer by molecular vibration, Brownian motion and electron migration,  Convection – transfer by bulk motion  Radiation - transfer by electro-magnetic (EM) waves. In many practical problems, two or even all of these mechanisms may need to be considered together. 1B Heat Transfer 3 1. Conductive Heat Transfer When a temperature gradient exists in a body, we are unsurprised to note that there is an energy transfer from the hotter to the cooler part. This process is called heat conduction, and experience shows that the rate of energy transfer is proportional to the normal temperature gradient, and therefore we can write 𝑄̇ 𝐴 ∝ 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑥 Where Q is the heat transfer (W), T is the temperature, A is the area perpendicular to the temperature gradient in the x direction. Generally we will use lower case q to indicate heat flow per unit area. The constant of proportionality is called the thermal conductivity  (W/mK), (note many texts use k), and since the heat transfer is in the direction of decreasing temperature, (the Second Law insists on this), 𝑄̇ 𝐴 = −𝜆 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑥 This is called Fourier’s Law of heat conduction; though note, (like for example Ohm’s Law), it is actually an empirical relationship. Table 1, below, gives some values for thermal conductivity at 20 ºC. There is always some variation of λ with temperature, though often it can be neglected.

Using Fourier’s Law – Conduction in one dimension Let us consider first a steady state, one dimensional heat flow. Consider a slab of material as in the figure below. For the element of thickness dx, the heat transferred into the face at x, and the heat conducted out of the face at x+dx, are given, per unit area, by:- 𝑞̇𝑥 = −𝜆 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑥 and 𝑞̇𝑥+𝑑𝑥 = 𝑞̇𝑥 + 𝑑 𝑑𝑥 (𝑞̇𝑥)𝑑𝑥 Note we have dropped the partial derivatives as this is a 1D problem (x variation only), in steady state (no time derivatives). At steady state there can be no accumulation of energy in the element, meaning that 𝑞̇𝑥 = 𝑞̇𝑥+𝑑𝑥 ⟹ 𝑞̇𝑥 = 𝑞̇𝑥 + 𝑑 𝑑𝑥 (𝑞̇𝑥)𝑑𝑥 𝑑 𝑑𝑥 (𝑞̇𝑥) = 0 so 𝑑 𝑑𝑥 (−𝜆 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑥) = 0 ⟹ −𝜆 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 = 𝑞̇ 𝑥 = 𝑄̇ 𝐴 If the thermal conductivity is constant, we get the obvious result that the temperature gradient is constant. Integrating again (with constant thermal conductivity), and inserting the boundary conditions, we obtain  211 TT l x TT  and   l TT λAQ 21   It is often useful to express the last equation as: A T2 qx dx qx+dx x = l T1 x 1B Heat Transfer 5   l TT λAQ 21    , 21 thR TT   where (by analogy with Ohm’s law) 𝑹𝒕𝒉 = 𝒍 𝝀𝑨 is the thermal resistance 1.2.

This should be obvious from the Ohms law analogy. Material B Material A 𝑄̇ 𝑇1 𝑇2 𝑇3 𝑥 “Voltage Drop” ↔ Temperature drop “Current” ↔ heat flow I = V/R 1B Heat Transfer 6 1.3. Another boundary condition - Convective heat losses at fluid interface Previously, we assumed the temperatures at the ends were known. Often heat from a surface is transferred to a flowing fluid (i.e. a convective boundary condition). The heat flux out of the solid is proportional to the temperature difference (T∞ - Twall), 𝑄̇ = −ℎ𝐴(𝑇∞ − 𝑇𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙) = ℎ𝐴 (𝑇𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙 − 𝑇∞) Where h is the coefficient of heat transfer and 𝑹𝒕𝒉 = 𝟏 𝒉𝑨 T∞ Twall AQqx / Solid Fluid x 1B Heat Transfer 7 1.4. Example- Double glazed windows. Determine the heat transfer through a window consisting of two 3 mm thick glass panes, with a gap of 7 mm between them. Take the convective heat transfer coefficient as 10 W/m2K, T0 = 5 °C, Ti = 25 °C; and assume that the air between the panes acts as a conductive layer. a = 0.026 W/mK and g = 0.78 W/mK.

Radial Heat Transfer – Cylinders, steady state conduction Consider a circular cylinder as shown, of length l. With boundary conditions:- at r = r1, T = T1, and at r = r2, T = T2.  𝑄̇ = −2𝜋𝑟𝑙𝜆 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑟  𝑄̇ is a constant  𝑞̇ = 𝑄̇ /𝐴 varies with r Starting with 𝑄̇ = −2𝜋𝑟𝑙𝜆 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑟 𝑄̇ 𝑟 = −2𝜋𝑙𝜆 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑟 ∫ 𝑄̇ 𝑟 𝑑𝑟 𝑟2 𝑟1 = − ∫ 2𝜋𝑙𝜆𝑑𝑇 𝑇2 𝑇1 𝑄̇ is a constant!

Example- Insulation on a pipe Note that as the area for heat transfer increases with radius, it is possible to add material but increase the heat transfer. For example, consider a hot pipe, wrapped n insulating material of thermal conductivity λ. The inner and outer radii of the insulating material are r1 and r2, respectively. The temperature at r1 is T1. The outer surface of the insulator is in contact with the environment, where the convective thermal resistance is 1 ℎ𝐴⁄ . The overall thermal resistance is thus 𝑅𝑡 = ln ( 𝑟2 𝑟1) 2𝜋𝜆𝑙 + 1 2𝜋𝑟2𝑙ℎ The first term on the RHS increases with insulator thickness, but the second term decreases. Therefore there can be a minimum value of 𝑅𝑡- i.e. there maybe some non-zero thickness of insulation that actually maximises the heat transfer! (There is a question in the exercise sheet that examines this behaviour in more detail.)

Key points for 1D steady heat conduction  The rate of heat flux is given by Fourier’s law, 𝑄̇ 𝐴 = −𝜆 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑥.  In a planar geometry, both the heat flux and the heat flow are constant.  In a cylindrical geometry, the heat flux is a function of position.  We can break problems down into a series of thermal resistances, and use the analogy with ohms law to build an equivalent circuit.  For a planar system, the thermal resistance of a material is given by 𝑅𝑡ℎ = 𝑙 𝜆𝐴  For a cylindrical system, the thermal resistance of a material is given by 𝑅𝑡ℎ = ln( 𝑟2 𝑟1) 2𝜋𝑙𝜆 .  Where heat is transferred from a surface to a fluid, the convective thermal resistance is given by 𝑅𝑡ℎ = 1 ℎ𝐴 . 1B Heat Transfer 11 We have already used the steady state form of this equation, i.e. 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑡 = 0 2. Unsteady Heat Conduction. Let’s return to conduction in a slab of planar material, but now relax the assumption that system is at steady state. We can also consider the case where heat is generated internally (ohmic heating for example). Let us assume that the internal heat generation is G W/m3, and that the temperature change of the element in time 𝛿𝑡 is 𝛿𝑇. The net energy input to the element must then equal the change in the internal energy of the element, so, 𝜌𝑐𝐴𝑑𝑥 𝛿𝑇 𝛿𝑡 = 𝑞𝑥𝐴 − [𝑞𝑥 + 𝜕𝑞𝑥 𝜕𝑥 𝑑𝑥] 𝐴 + 𝐺𝐴𝑑𝑥 Accumulation = Energy inflow – energy outflow + Generation where c is the material specific heat. 𝜌𝑐 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑡 = − 𝜕𝑞𝑥 𝜕𝑥 + 𝐺 𝜌𝑐 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑡 = − 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 [−𝜆 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑥] + 𝐺 If the thermal conductivity is constant, then the above equation reduces to 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑡 = ( 𝜆 𝜌𝑐) 𝜕2𝑇 𝜕𝑥2 + 𝐺 𝜌𝑐 𝝀 𝝆𝒄⁄ = 𝜶 is called the thermal diffusivity (m2/s). In the absence of internal heat generation, we have the 1D transient heat diffusion equation, 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑡 = 𝛼 𝜕2𝑇 𝜕𝑥2 Exact solutions of this equation only exist for a few simple geometries and boundary conditions, so numerical solution is usually required.

Example- conduction in a semi-infinite slab This is one case where it is possible to derive an analytical solution (you will not be asked to reproduce this, it is included here for illustrative purposes only) 𝜃 = 𝑇 − 𝑇0 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇0 = 1 − erf ( 𝑥 2√𝛼𝑡) Characteristic time for heat to penetrate a distance x is when, 𝑥 √𝛼𝑡 = 1 (𝑠𝑎𝑦) 𝑖. 𝑒. 𝑡 = 𝑥2 𝛼 More generally, the “characteristic time” for heat diffusion is  2s , where s is a characteristic dimension of the body, e.g. (volume)/(surface area).

Lumped Heat Capacity Analysis In many situations, a transient heat transfer situation involves a solid (with relatively low “internal” thermal resistance) and a solid/fluid interface with a relatively high thermal resistance. In such cases, the assumption can often be made that the solid body is at a uniform temperature. Let us consider a “lump” of material of specific heat c, density ρ, volume V, area A, with convective heat transfer coefficient h. If the temperature is uniform throughout the body, then we can write 𝑐𝜌𝑉 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑡 = −𝑄̇ = −[ℎ𝐴(𝑇 − 𝑇∞)] If the initial condition is 0at0  tTT , the solution is            cτ t TT TT exp 0 , where hAVρcτc / . The analogy with a first order electrical RC network is clear, 2.2.1. When is the lumped capacity model valid? As noted above, the assumption is that 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = 𝑠 𝜆𝐴 1 ℎ𝐴 = ℎ𝑠 𝜆 ≪ 1 [where s = V/A is assumed to represent a characteristic length scale of the body]. The group ℎ𝑠 𝜆⁄ is called the Biot number (Bi). Though arbitrary, Bi < 0.1 is often used as an acceptable condition for applying a lumped heat capacity analysis TT∞ R = 1/hA 𝐶 = 𝑐𝜌𝑉 𝑄̇ = ℎ𝐴(𝑇 − 𝑇∞) 1B Heat Transfer 14 2.3. Worked Example A steel ball (specific heat 0.46 kJ/kg.K, λ = 55W/m.K, density = 7800 kg/m3) 5 cm in diameter, initially at 450 °C, is placed in an environment at 100 °C. The convection heat transfer coefficient is 100 W/m2K. Should a lumped heat capacity approach be used? – If so, what is the cooling time constant? First we need to calculate the Biot number 𝐵𝑖 = ℎ𝑠 𝜆 = ℎ𝑉 𝜆𝐴 = ℎ 𝜋𝑑3 6 𝜆 𝜋𝑑2 = ℎ𝑑 6𝜆 = 100 × 0.05 6 × 55 = 0.0126 Therefore the lumped heat capacity model is appropriate! The time constant for heating is 𝜏𝑐 = 𝑐𝜌𝑉 ℎ𝐴 = 𝑐𝜌𝑑 ℎ6 = 460 × 7800 × 0.05 6 × 100 = 299 𝑠 (5 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠) t (s) T (°C) 450 100 0 c =299 229 1B Heat Transfer 15 2.4. Key Points for unsteady conduction  The “characteristic time” for heat diffusion through a body is  2s , where s is a characteristic dimension of the body, e.g. (volume)/(surface area).  𝛼 = 𝜆/𝜌𝑐, is the thermal diffusivity.  The Fourier number is the ratio of time, to the characteristic time for heat diffusion, i.e. 𝐹𝑜 = 𝛼𝜏 𝑠2  The Biot number is given by Bi = ℎ𝑠 𝜆⁄ .  When Bi < 0.1 conduction within the body is very fast, compared to transport of heat to the body by convection from the environment. The body can be treated as if it has a uniform temperature. 1B Heat Transfer 16 3. Heat Exchangers There is little need to emphasise the importance of heat exchangers – they are all around us – in vehicles (the “radiator”, the passenger compartment heater, the oil cooler), in power stations (the “boiler”, feed heaters), etc. One of the most common forms of heat exchanger consists of banks of tubes (known as a shell and tube heat exchanger). Cooler “hot fluid” (tube side) Hotter “cold fluid” (shell side) Cold “cold fluid” (shell side) Hot “hot fluid” (tube side) 1B Heat Transfer 17 3.1. The overall heat transfer coefficient Previously, in the double glazed window example, we determined an overall thermal resistance for the combination of convection  hA1 and conduction  Ax  resistances, such that the heat transfer is given by overallthRTQ , . Though this formulation is to be preferred, common usage is to express the same relationship as TUAQ  , where U is called the Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient, and overallthRUA ,1 . For problems with radial conduction, there is the issue of what area A refers to. Consider the pipe, of length l as shown, with inner and outer radii r1 and r2, respectively. The equivalent circuit for this problem is: Giving an overall resistance of 𝑅𝑡 = 1 A1h1 + ln ( 𝑟2 𝑟1) 2𝜋𝜆𝑙 + 1 𝐴2ℎ2 and 𝑄̇ = 𝑈1𝐴1(𝑇1 − 𝑇2) = 𝑈2𝐴2(𝑇1 − 𝑇2) = 𝑇1 − 𝑇2 𝑅𝑡 𝑈1𝐴1 = 𝑈2𝐴2 = 1 𝑅𝑡 and so   22 1121 1 1 1 2 1 1 hA A lπλ rrA h U   ln   2 122 11 2 2 1 2 1 1 hlπλ rrA hA A U   ln T1 T2 R2 = ln (𝑟2 𝑟1) /2𝜋𝜆𝑙 𝑅3 = 1 𝐴2ℎ2 𝑅1 = 1 𝐴1ℎ1 h1 h2 T1 A1 l T2 A2 1B Heat Transfer 18 Where U1 is the “Overall heat transfer coefficient based on the inner diameter” and U2 is the “Overall heat transfer coefficient based on the outer diameter”. 3.2. Performance of heat exchangers One of the simplest heat exchanger geometries is as shown in the figure. This is called a co- or parallel-flow HX (we will use this common abbreviation for Heat eXchanger); if the fluids were flowing in opposite directions, it would be termed a counter-flow HX. Clearly the heat transfer is taking place due to a continuously changing temperature difference, so at first sight it appears a tricky problem to predict the total heat exchanged, but clearly there must be some “mean” temperature mT , which is defined by mTUAQ  (where UA is either 11AU or 22 AU ). Consider a small element of the heat exchanger of area dA, where the heat exchanged is Qd  .  chccchhh TTUdAdTcmdTcmQd   We will assume that U, the overall heat transfer coefficient, and the fluid specific heats are constant.

These relationships apply to counter-flow HX’s as well1. 1 You can also easily show that this also holds when the temperature is constant on one side of the heat exchanger, e.g., when steam is condensing on the shell side of an exchanger. 1B Heat Transfer 20 3.2.1. Co-flow heat exchanger T-Q plot  Δ𝑇𝑚 = Δ𝑇2− Δ𝑇1 𝑙𝑛( Δ𝑇2 Δ𝑇1) with Δ𝑇2 = 𝑇ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡 − 𝑇𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡 , Δ𝑇1 = 𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑛 − 𝑇𝑐𝑖𝑛  The gradient of a T-Q plot is 1/{𝑚̇ 𝑐}  For a co – flow heat exchanger, the maximum heat transfer is when the exit temperatures become equal (𝑇ℎ2 = 𝑇𝑐2)  Maximum heat transfer requires infinite heat transfer area, Δ𝑇𝑙𝑚 = 0 T Th1 Tc1 Th2 Tc2 𝑄̇ = 𝑚̇ ℎ𝑐ℎ(𝑇ℎ1 − 𝑇ℎ2) Amount of heat transferred 𝑄̇ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 1B Heat Transfer 21 3.2.2. Counter flow heat exchanger T-Q plot  As you move along the heat exchanger, the cold stream can approach the inlet hot fluid temperature OR the hot stream can approach the inlet temperature of the cold fluid. It depends on which stream has the lowest 𝑚̇ 𝑐.  At end (2) the coldest hot fluid transfers heat to the coldest cold fluid. At end (1) the hottest hot fluids transfers heat to the hottest cold fluid. o The lower temperature difference reduces irreversibilities. o More heat can be transferred.  Δ𝑇𝑚 = Δ𝑇2− Δ𝑇1 𝑙𝑛( Δ𝑇2 Δ𝑇1) with Δ𝑇2 = 𝑇ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡 − 𝑇𝑐𝑖𝑛 , Δ𝑇1 = 𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑛 − 𝑇𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡  As drawn, with the cold flow having the lowest value 𝑚̇ 𝑐, the maximum heat possible heat transfer is when 𝑇𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑛.  Maximum heat transfer requires infinite heat transfer area, Δ𝑇𝑙𝑚 = 0 T Th1 Tc1 Th2=Thout Tc2= Tcin 𝑄̇ = 𝑚̇ ℎ𝑐ℎ(𝑇ℎ1 − 𝑇ℎ2) Amount of heat transferred 𝑄̇ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑛 − 𝑇𝑐𝑖𝑛) 1B Heat Transfer 22 3.2.3. Summary of T-Q plots and heat exchanger effectiveness  For a constant 𝑚̇ 𝑐, the lines of T vs Q are straight.  The maximum possible heat exchange will always be  mincm , times the biggest temperature difference existing in the HX.  Maximum possible heat exchange requires an infinite area for heat transfer  The effectiveness (ε) of a HX is defined as the actual heat exchange, divided by the maximum possible (achieved in counter flow mode).

Key points for heat exchangers  We often use an overall heat transfer coefficient U, whose value depends on the area it is associated with.  The temperature difference varies along the heat exchanger. The correct appropriate average driving force for heat transfer is the log mean temperature difference.  Counter flowing heat exchangers are better than co-flowing heat exchangers.  The effectiveness (ε) of a HX is defined as the actual heat exchange, divided by the maximum possible (achieved in counter flow mode). 1B Heat Transfer last edited sas37/2018 1 4. Convective Heat Transfer (Forced Convection) 4.1. Introduction In 1987, Cray Research Inc. released the Cray-2, then the world’s fastest computer at 250MHz with 2Gb of RAM. It was contained in a cylindrical cabinet 1.15m high and 1.35m in diameter. “We solved the problem of dissipating the 130kW it produced by immersing all the circuitry in a bath of inert liquid ﬂuorocarbon. Computer designers are gloriﬁed cooling engineers and I am a very good plumber. “ Seymour Cray We have already used a convective boundary condition The heat transfer coefficient, h, is defined by: 𝑞̇ = − ℎ ∆𝑇 h may vary with position, e.g. x, (see later). Often we will use the averaged heat transfer coefficient, 𝑄 𝐴 ̇ = − ℎ𝑎𝑣∆𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  h and hav tend to get used interchangeably, depending upon the problem.  Often, we will want the average heat transfer coefficient, and the fluid mechanics will be too complicated to allow us to calculate the local value. We need to be able to estimate the values of h. There are two distinct situations we need to consider; 1. Forced convection- when the fluid is driven over the surface by e.g. a fan or pump. 2. Free (natural) convection – when density differences due to buoyancy drive the flow. Forced convection is almost always the quickest way to transfer heat. In both situations, we must consider the flow of fluid over the surface. In this lecture we will consider Forced Convection 𝑇∞ 𝑇𝑤 𝑞̇ Solid ∆𝑇 = 𝑇∞ − 𝑇𝑤 Fluid 𝑉 1B Heat Transfer last edited sas37/2018 2 4.2. Heat transfer and fluid mechanics The thermal (temperature) field of a flow cannot affect the mechanical (pressure and velocity) fields if the density is assumed to be constant. We can calculate the mechanical fields first and then calculate their effect on the temperature field. The mechanical fields, however, always affect the thermal field, both by viscous dissipation and simply by convecting hot fluid through space (i.e. forced convection). If the density cannot be assumed to be constant, the calculation requires feedback from the thermal to the mechanical ﬁeld and is more complicated. From the equation of state of ideal gases1, ρ = P/RT , we see that dρ/ρ = −dT/T . Incompressibility can be assumed when temperature fluctuations are less than approximately 0.1 of the background temperature. Incompressibility also requires that the Mach number is less than around 0.3. 𝑀 < 0.3 ⟹ 𝑐𝑝𝑇 ≫ 𝑣 2/2 i.e the enthalpy of the fluid per unit mass, 𝑐𝑝𝑇, is much greater than the kinetic energy per unit mass 𝑣 2/2. The convective energy transfer is then just 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝𝑇, and the steady flow energy equation becomes 𝑄̇ − 𝑊𝑥̇ = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (𝑐𝑝𝑇 + 1 2 𝑣 2 + 𝑔𝑧)𝑖𝑛 − 𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑐𝑝𝑇 + 1 2 𝑣 2 + 𝑔𝑧)𝑜𝑢𝑡 The properties of the fluid, such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, depend on temperature. Although this does not provide a mechanism for energy to pass from the thermal to the mechanical field, it does allow the thermal field slightly to affect the mechanical field. If temperature differences are small, the variations in these properties are small. Very often the properties are assumed to take the values at the mean value of the temperature, the film temperature. 1 In other fluids, with other equations of state, we must be careful not to be near a region of sudden density change such as the boiling point.

Non-dimensional heat transfer coefficients In many situations, the fluid mechanics will be too complicated to allow the heat transfer coefficient to be computed directly. We will have to resort to dimensional analysis and correlations. Nusselt Number (commonly used) The Nusselt Number is found by normalising the heat flux, but a conductive heat flux.

Reynolds’ analogy (Prandtl number = 1) If the Prandtl number equals 1, the momentum diffusivity equals the thermal diffusivity. This means that the non-dimensional equations of heat and momentum transfer are identical. In some situations, the non-dimensional boundary conditions are also identical. This means that the non-dimensional solutions are identical and therefore that there is a direct relationship between the mechanical and thermal fields. This is Reynolds’ analogy. To demonstrate this, we will revisit the flow over a flat plate. 4.5.1.

Heat transfer if the Prandtl number ≠1 If the Prandtl number is not equal to 1, the transport equations are no longer identical and we have two types of boundary layer: a momentum boundary layer and a thermal boundary layer.

The forced convection experiment In most situations, the flow field is too complicated to be calculated by hand. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used but this is often expensive and may not be accurate. It can be easier to perform an experiment on a geometrically-identical situation and then scale up with the relevant non- dimensional parameters. You do this in the 1B heat transfer experiment of forced convection over a platinum wire. 1. List the dependent and independent variables Dependent Independent 2. Count the dimensions 3. Create dimensionless numbers When you plot the Nusselt number as a function of Reynolds number (given that air has a fixed Prandtl number) you find that your results collapse to a single line. 1B Heat Transfer last edited sas37/2018 13 The physics is encapsulated in this line. For a gas with the same Prandtl number as air, you can use the chart you created to calculated the heat transfer from a geometrically similar situation of any size, between the Reynolds number ranges that you studied. In heat transfer problems you usually have to rely on dimensional analysis and scaling. 4.10. Key Points for Forced Convection  Heat transfer takes place in boundary layers and is strongly influenced by the state, size, etc. of the local boundary layer.  There is a strong analogy between heat transfer and momentum transfer leading to Reynolds Analogy f p cSt Vc h 2 1    The local heat transfer coefficient for a flat plate can be derived from a simple model of the velocity profile  Turbulent boundary layers involve higher heat transfer than laminar ones.  Correlations (i.e. curve fits to experimental data) will be different for different states of boundary layers (laminar, transitional, turbulent) and it is important to check.  For more general problems  PrRe,fn λDh Nu av av  1B Heat Transfer 1 5. Natural Convection In general, natural or free convection results in a smaller heat transfer than that due to forced convection. It will usually be swamped by forced convection when the latter is present, but many important flows (including all flows of air within buildings and many environmental ones are driven by natural convection). 5.1. Characteristics of Natural Convection When heated, fluids expand and are driven upward by buoyancy forces. For these flows there is no natural reference velocity (there is no \"free stream\"). There is this no natural Reynolds Number associated with the flow. There is, however, an upward velocity driven by buoyancy and examination of Schlieren pictures of naturally-convecting flows reveals what appear to be thermal boundary layers on heated objects. The fundamental questions are:- what are the important parameters; how do we scale them, etc? We have all experienced natural convection. In general, we do not notice pressure forces - hold your hand over a candle (for a short time!). We notice the heat transfer but are not aware of any upward pressure force, as we would when there was a significant free stream velocity. We will assume that pressure variations due to convection are in general small and that the motion is, therefore, driven primarily by changes in density. 5.2. How big are the  's ? We not expect large changes in density, but it appears that they are sufficient to show up optically in air due to changes in the refractive index (which is a function of density). In order to deal equally easily with liquids and gases it is convenient to use a coefficient of expansion. pT v v    1  where v is the specific volume. Since 1v  0  dvdv   d v dv  so that 1 pT       (For liquids,  is effectively independent of pressure, so that it doesn't matter what is held constant). For small density changes (assuming constant pressure) T T p       T  where  is the mean value of density For a liquid,  must be obtained from tables.

How big are the velocities that these  's drive ? We find a very rough order of magnitude estimate by looking at a simple problem - the flow near a vertical flat plate. We expect the flow to be driven upwards near the warm plate but farther away, the flow will be at rest. In fact we are expecting some sort of boundary layer behaviour, but this time, the vertical velocity will be zero at the wall and also as we move to the edge of the boundary layer, where the shear stress will also vanish.

Typical Free Convection Boundary Layer Type Flows The figures shown previously are taken from Van Dyke's Book \"An Album of Fluid Motion\". This type of picture is referred to as an interferogram, which is obtained by double exposing pictures with and without the flow. The refractive index of air is a function of its density and each fringe (a black region or a white region) corresponds to a constant density change (which is equivalent to a constant temperature change since the pressure is effectively constant in these flows). The left hand one is a plume of hot air rising above a heated element, the middle one is the boundary layer on a uniformly heated plate and the final one is the flow over a heated cylinder. Note:- (a) The flows are all laminar (because the velocities involved are small). (b) The boundary layer on the cylinder does not separate (there are no pressure gradients, therefore no adverse pressure gradients) but meets at the top and is then shed as a rising plume. 1B Heat Transfer 6 Taken from An Album of Fluid Motion by Milton Van Dyke 1B Heat Transfer 7 5.5.

Heat Transfer by Radiation Heat can be transferred by Electromagnetic waves emitted by a body as a result of its temperature. It does not require a medium between the bodies (e.g. sun to earth), and can occur through a medium which is colder than either body. Figure 1. Electromagnetic Spectrum, source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum Thermal radiation lies approximately in the wavelength range 0.1μm to 100 μm (3.1015 to 3.1012 Hz), visible light is in the range 0.35 μm to 0.75 μm. 6.1. The black body A “black body” is an idealised object, which will 1. completely absorb all radiation incident upon it. 2. emit the largest amount of energy per unit area possible for a given temperature The maximum rate at which a body can radiate energy is given by the Stefan- Boltzmann Law1 𝐸𝑏 = 𝜎𝑇4 where σ (= 5.67x10-8 Wm-2K-4) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and Eb is called the black body emissive power. 1 The Stefan-Boltzmann Law can be derived from statistical mechanics, which is beyond the scope of this course. 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 2 The monochromatic emissive power of a black body2 (i.e. the power emitted between wavelengths  and +d) is given by the relationship 1 2 5 1    Tcb e c E   where λ is the wavelength, c1 = 3.743x108 Wμm/m2, and c2 = 1.4387x104 μmK. If one integrates this expression over all wavelengths we obtain 𝐸𝑏 = ∫ 𝐸𝑏𝜆𝑑𝜆 ∞ 0 = 𝜎𝑇4 The figure below shows plots from the equation for bE for a range of temperatures. Figure 2. Spectrum of radiation from a black body Note that the peak moves to shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature – the visible spectrum is between 0.4 μm (violet) and 0.7μm (red), so we would expect a body being heated to appear dull red first, then a colour change through orange to yellow etc. The peak value of bE is at a wavelength m T  6.2897 max  How hot is the surface of the sun? The sun’s surface behaves almost as a black body, with a temperature of about 5780K – from the relationship above 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 2897.6 5780 = 0.5 𝜇𝑚 -not surprisingly, in the visible range. 2 This is a result from statistical thermodynamics and its derivation is beyond the scope of this course. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 0 5 10 15d(Q/A)/d(kWm-2 m-1) Wavelength (m) 600 K 800 K 1000 K 1200 K 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 3 6.2. Real surfaces Real surfaces emit less radiation than a black body. The monochromatic emissivity  characterises the surface 𝜀𝜆 = radiation emmited per unit area between λ and λ+dλ 𝐸𝑏𝜆 The monochromatic emissivity is a function of the wavelength of radiation, . The total emissivity (usually just called the emissivity) is given by In general the emissivity is a function of temperature.

Absorption, transmission and reflection When radiation strikes a surface, a fraction (= ρ, the reflectivity) will be reflected, a fraction (= α, the absorbtivity) will be absorbed, and a fraction (= τ, the transmissivity) will be transmitted. Thus 1  . Most solid bodies do not transmit thermal radiation, so the transmissivity can be taken as zero, hence 1 . The reflected part of the radiation may be “specular” (i.e. as from a mirror), diffuse (i.e. scattered equally in all directions), or some combination of these. Most surfaces are predominately diffuse reflectors. 6.2.3. Kirchhoff’s identity Due to processes occurring at the quantum scale (very very small!), the probability of a photon being absorbed on hitting the surface, is equal to the probability of a photon being emitted. This gives rise to Kirchhoff’s identity. Kirchhoff’s identity, 𝜺 = 𝜶, i.e. the absorptivity is equal to the emissivity. There is a question on the example sheet which “proves” this must be true for a body exchanging radiation with black enclosure, at equilibrium. However, Kirchhoff’s identity is generally true. 6.2.4. Radiation to and from a non -black bodies. The total radiative emission from a non-black body surface not only has an 𝜀𝐸𝑏 component (the radiation leaving a surface due to its temperature), but also a  times the incident radiation’ component. Let us define two new terms: G = Irradiation. The total radiation incident on a surface per unit time and area J = Radiosity. The total radiation leaving a surface per unit time and area. We further assume that these quantities are uniform over each surface: this needs to be kept in mind when applying the results to come.

Since   11 (the surfaces are assumed to be non-transmissive), the expression for J may be written 𝐽 = 𝜀𝐸𝑏 + (1 − 𝜀)𝐺 𝐺 = 𝐽 − 𝜀𝐸𝑏 1 − 𝜀 Now the net radiation leaving a surface per unit area per unit time  AQ / is the difference between the radiosity and the irradiation, so 𝑄̇ 𝐴 = 𝐽 − 𝐺 = 𝜀𝐸𝑏 + (1 − 𝜀)𝐺 − 𝐺 If we substitute for G, we obtain   A JE Q b    1  .

Radiative exchange between surfaces Let us examine the heat transfer between two surfaces 1A and 2A (both diffuse reflectors) We define 12F as the fraction of energy leaving surface 1 that arrives at surface 2 21F as the fraction of energy leaving surface 2 that arrives at surface 1  Fi,j is called the shape factor (or sometimes the view factor)  Fi,j is purely geometric and is related to how much of surface j can be seen by surface i Since electromagnetic rays travel in straight lines, if radiation can travel from 1 to 2 along a path, it can also travel from 2 to 1 along the same path. This means that view factors are linked by the reciprocity relationship. 212121 FAFA  sinceit is purely geometric this does not depend the nature of the radiation emitted or reflected from the surface. Of the total radiation that leaves surface 1 ( 11 AJ ), a quantity 1211 FAJ reaches surface 2. Likewise from 2 to 1, a quantity 2122 FAJ reaches surface 2 from surface 1. The net exchange is thus given by 2122121112 FAJFAJQ  But 212121 FAFA  , so 121 21 12 1 FA JJ Q   We interpret this expression in an “Ohm’s Law” way, regarding 12Q as a current flow, 21 JJ  as a potential difference, and 121 1 FA as a ‘space’ resistance. The determination of shape factors for other than the simplest geometries is tedious and normally done by computer or taken from graphical data. However we shall now see, certain useful results can be deduced by physical reasoning. 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 7 6.3.1. Shape factor algebra Consider the radiation exchange situation shown in the figure – the L- section is extends infinitely into the page, and for simplicity, let us assume surfaces 1 and 2 are of equal length in the plane of the page. Typically we will be interested in the radiation exchange between the three surfaces, 3 representing the environment. Ignore for the moment the dashed line (surface 4). Shape factors for a surface add up to unity By definition, the shape factor is the fraction of energy leaving one surface and hitting another, therefore 1131211  FFF Note that we have included the self shape factor, F11, since a surface may be able to see itself. Convex surfaces cannot see themselves – self view factor = 0 In the above figure, surface 1 cannot see itself, so F11 = 0. Reciprocity As demonstrated above, for example, F12A1 = F21A2, where A1=A2 in this example. Using these rules (and simple logic), we can for example, calculate F12. By drawing the imaginary surface 4, we note that 11214  FF , so if we can find 14F the problem is solved. By reciprocity: 𝐴1𝐹14 = 𝐴4𝐹41 And by symmetry 𝐹41 = 0.5 𝐹14 = 0.5 𝐴4 𝐴1 ⟹ 𝐹14 = √2 2 𝐹12 = 1 − 𝐹14 = 1 − √2 2 = .293 Note that this relationship applies to black and non-black bodies, but the radiation must be diffuse. 3 4 2 1 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 8 2 6.3.2.

The radiation network is Thus, the overall “resistance” is 1 − 𝜀1 𝜀1𝐴1 + 1 A1F12 + 1 − 𝜀2 𝜀2𝐴2 So that the heat exchanged between 1 and 2 is, 𝑄̇ = (𝜎𝑇1 4 − 𝜎𝑇2 4) ( 1 − 𝜀1 𝜀1𝐴1 + 1 A1F12 + 1 − 𝜀2 𝜀2𝐴2 ) Since 112 F , and multiplying top and bottom by A1, 𝑄̇ = 𝐴1(𝜎𝑇1 4 − 𝜎𝑇2 4) ( 1 − 𝜀1 𝜀1 + 1 + (A1 A2) (1 − 𝜀2) 𝜀2 ) Note that this expression is valid whether the cylinders are concentric or not; in fact either cylinder can be any shape as long as 011 F - i.e. the inner cylinder cannot see itself. A very useful result is obtained when 2A (or 12  ), which is that 𝑄̇ = 𝐴1𝜀1(𝜎𝑇1 4 − 𝜎𝑇2 4) This expression is quite general – it says (in words) that when an object is in a large enclosure, the net radiation exchange is independent of the emissivity of the enclosure, and it is as if the enclosure were a black body. A couple of lines of manipulation of the relationships above shows that 21 bEG  for 12 AA  , i.e. all the radiation striking surface 1, appears as if it has come from a black body.

Radiation in the environment Solar radiation is very different to most terrestrial radiation, in that it is at much shorter wavelengths, and many important phenomena that affect us directly relate to this.

Example- a simple model of the greenhouse effect A very simple model of the green house gas effect shows how the wave length difference between solar and terrestrial radiation is central. Previously we assumed that the absorbance, reflectivity and emissivity were not functions of wavelength, when considering the greenhouse effect, this approximation is no longer valid. Albedo, A = the fraction of the incident (i.e. short wave) radiation which is reflected First consider a planet, radius R, with a solar flux (short wave radiation) of S Wm-2, and an albedo of A. For long wave radiation, the planet can be taken to be black. The overall energy (short wave) absorbed is projected area×S × fraction absorbed, i.e.  ARSQs  1 2 If the planet’s surface is at eT , then the (mainly long wave) energy emitted is 424 ep TRQ  . At steady state 𝑄̇ 𝑠 = 𝑄̇ 𝑝 giving 𝜎𝑇𝑒 4 = 𝑆(1 − 𝐴) 4 For S = 1000 Wm-2, and average value of the albedo, A = 0.1, we get Te = 250 K, too cold to support life on earth! We have neglected fact that the Earth's atmosphere contains gases that absorb the longwave radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. S F = 𝜎𝑇𝑒 4 Sun Earth at temperature Te 1B Heat Transfer sas37 17/11/2016 13 Consider the (simplified) situation shown below, where we have (very crudely) assumed that infra-red absorbing gases form a layer of some thickness above the surface, spread equally over the entire planet. The overall energy (short wave) absorbed is projected area×S × fraction absorbed, i.e.  ARSQs  1 2 The gas layer absorbs F, and itself emits a radiative (infra-red) flux of H. Since the layer is elevated from the surface, it emits radiation through both its upper and lower surface in equal amounts. Thus overall the layer emits a total flux of 2H W m-2. In this new situation the outer surface of the absorbing layer becomes the outer surface of the planet, so that the amount of energy radiated by the planet becomes, HRQ p 24 . At steady sate 𝑄̇ 𝑠 = 𝑄̇ 𝑝 giving   4 1 SA H   (*) At the surface, the energy balance is: 4𝜋𝑅2𝐹 = 𝐻 4𝜋𝑅2 + (1 − 𝐴)𝑆𝜋𝑅2 i.e. 𝐹 = 𝐻 + (1−𝐴)𝑆 4 Using this result to eliminate H from (*) gives:   2 14 SA TF e   The addition of one IR absorbing layer has thus changed the balance of energy at the ground. Using the same values of S (=1000 Wm-2) and A (=0.1) as before, we now get Te = 298.5 K. Without the greenhouse effect, life on earth would not exist!

Key points for Radiative heat transfer  The power per unit area emitted by a black body is 𝐸𝑏 = 𝜎𝑇4  Emissivity is the ratio of actual power emitted to that emitted by a black body at the same temperature.  A grey surface has a constant emissivity which does not depend on wavelength. For a real (grey) surface the power emitted is 𝐸 = 𝜀𝜎𝑇4     (reflectivity + transmissivity + absorptivity = 1)  The absorptivity is equal to the emissivity (Kirchhoff’s law),     The irradiation, G, is the total power arriving on a unit area of a surface  The radiosity, J, is the total power leaving a unit area of a surface. 𝐽 = 𝜌𝐺 + 𝐸  The shape/view factor between two surfaces is a geometric quantity which gives the amount of radiation leaving one surface and hitting the other.  We can construct an electrical circuit analogy for a radiation problem.  Without the greenhouse effect, the earth would be too cold to support life. Too much infra-red absorbing gas in the atmosphere will cause global warming.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
