The fundamental frequency is rads/s, so we place the components at : 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 5 10 15 20 25 frequency ω (rad/s)ω 0 2ω 0 |c 1| |c 2| Figure 3: Fourier coeﬀicients for periodically repeated signal. 5 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation What happens if we repeat this procedure, each time increasing the period T and including more of the non-periodic signal? • Fundamental frequency ω0 = 2π/T decreases, so frequency components get closer and closer together • As T → ∞ we have a frequency component at every frequency ω. • This is the idea behind the Fourier Transform; see figure 4 to see how the Fourier series gradually converges to give a continuous coverage of the frequency axis. 6 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation −500 0 500 −0.5 0 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 10 20 30 −500 0 500 −0.5 0 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 10 20 30 −500 0 500 −0.5 0 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 10 20 30 −500 0 500 −0.5 0 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 10 20 30 T=80 T=160 T=320 Periodic Signal Fourier Series t ω Figure 4: Fourier series as T → ∞. 7 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Mathematical formulation • Start with the complex Fourier series coeﬀicient formula for a function f(t): cn = 1 T ∫ T/2 −T/2 f(t)e−jω0ntdt (1) with ω0 = 2π/T, as before. • cn is the Fourier series component with frequency nω0. Now, define some function of frequency DT(ω) which equals Tcn at the points ω = nω0, i.e. DT(nω0) = Tcn, n = −∞, ..., −1, 0, 1, ..., +∞ (2) 8 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation DT therefore looks like: ω0 2ω0 3ω0 Frequency ω c1T c2T c3T Figure 5: The function DT(ω) (cn are shown as real-valued) 9 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation • Hence we can write DT(nω0) = Tcn = ∫ T/2 −T/2 f(t)e−jω0ntdt (3) • A suitable possibility for the function DT(ω) which satisfies the constraint of (3) is simply obtained by replacing nω0 with a continuous variable ω in the above formula: DT(ω) = ∫ T/2 −T/2 f(t)e−jωtdt (4) • As we increase the period T, so ω0 decreases, and the discrete points DT(nω0) define the whole function DT(ω) for all values of ω. 10 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation • The Fourier Transform F(ω) is obtained as the limit of DT(ω) as T → ∞, i.e. F(ω) = Lim T→∞D(ω) = lim T→∞ ∫ T/2 −T/2 f(t)e−jωtdt = ∫ ∞ −∞ f(t)e−jωtdt The Fourier transform is often referred to as the Fourier spectrum of a signal. Comment: why is there a factor of T in the derivation? (See (3)). This serves to ‘normalise’ the integral - otherwise the integral would be zero for most functions! 11 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Interpretation of Fourier Transform • The Fourier Transform is one of the most important and useful tools of signal analysis and mathematics in general. • The Fourier series showed how to split a periodic signal into its constituent frequency components at ω0, 2ω0, ... • Since the Fourier transform is derived as a limiting case of a Fourier series (T → ∞), we can interpret it in a similar way. With the Fourier transform, however, we can analyse non-periodic functions and obtain their frequency components at any frequency ω . • Thus the Fourier transform is a much more generally applicable tool. 12 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Example Consider the ‘double exponential’ function (with a > 0): f(t) = { −30 −20 −10 0 10 20 30 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 13 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Calculate the Fourier transform of f(t): F(ω) = ∫ ∞ −∞ f(t)e−jωtdt = ∫ 0 −∞ eate−jωtdt + ∫ ∞ 0 e−ate−jωtdt = The following figure shows the Fourier coeﬀicients cnT for 3 increasing values of T. The bottom plot has the Fourier transform overlayed as the continuous line - an almost perfect match. 14 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation −30 −20 −10 0 10 20 30 0 0.5 1 −10 −8 −6 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 −10 −8 −6 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 −10 −8 −6 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 Figure 6: (from top to bottom) a) the original function b) the Fourier coeﬀicients, cnT, when interval taken is [−6, 6], c) coeﬀicients for [−10.5, 10.5], d) coeﬀicients for [−15, 15], overlayed with the Fourier transform of f(t) (solid line) 15 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation The Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) It is possible to invert the Fourier transform to determine uniquely the signal f(t) from its Fourier Transform F(ω). We derive the required formula using results for δ-functions from Handout 1. Start from the Fourier transform formula: F(ω) = (5) where a new time variable t′ is used for convenience. Multiply F(ω) by ejωt and integrate wrt ω: I = ∫ ∞ −∞ F(ω)ejωtdω = ∫ ∞ ω=−∞ ∫ ∞ t′=−∞ f(t′)e−jωt′e jωt dt′ dω (6) 16 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Now change order of integration I = ∫ ∞ t′=−∞ (7) Recall in Handout 1 we showed the result ∫ ∞ −∞ ejωτdω = . (8) Using this result with τ = t − t′: I = 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ = (9) where the final integral is done using the sifting property of δ-functions, as revised in Handout 1 17 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Now rearrange to get: f(t) = I 2π = 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ This is a unique expression for f(t) in terms of F(ω), the Inverse Fourier Transform. 18 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation The forward and inverse Fourier transform pair can now be summarised as (see EI data book): Fourier Transform F(ω) = ∫ ∞ −∞ f(t)e−jωtdt (10) (11) Inverse Fourier Transform f(t) = 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ F(ω)e jωtdω (12) 19 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Note - you may encounter some slightly different definitions of the Fourier transform. For example, if F(ω) is redefined as then both the forward and inverse transforms have a factor of before the integral and the transform is ‘symmetric’. But these other definitions make no difference whatsoever to the principle of operation. In this course we will stick with the definitions given in equations (10) and (12). 20 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Some Important Fourier Transforms [Most of these are also given in the EI data book] Complex exponential f(t) = exp(jω0t) for a fixed frequency ω0. F(ω) = ∫ ∞ −∞ f(t)e−jωtdt = = Once again, this integral follows from result in Handout 1. As expected, all of the frequency content of f(t) = exp(jω0t) is concentrated on the frequency ω0 as a δ-function. 21 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Check result using inverse Fourier Transform: f(t) = 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ F(ω)e jωtdω = = as required. 22 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Cosine f(t) = cos(ω0t). Writing cos(ω0t) = 1 2 (exp(jω0t) + exp(−jω0t)) we obtain the result immediately from the Fourier transform of exp(jω0t): F(ω) = (13) This follows because the Fourier Transform is linear, i.e. for two functions f1(t) and f2(t): FT{af1(t) + bf2(t)} = 23 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation −5 0 5 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5cos(wt) t −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 7: Fourier transform of cosine 24 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Sine. f(t) = sin(ω0t). Using the same method as for cosine: F(ω) = (14) 25 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation δ-function f(t) = aδ(t), where a is a constant. Its Fourier transform is F(ω) = (15) i.e. a constant for all frequencies. DC offset f(t) = a, where a is a constant. Fourier transform is F(ω) = a ∫ ∞ −∞ e−jωtdt = (16) 26 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation Rectangular pulse Consider the rectangular pulse f(t) = { b for −T/2 < t < T/2 0 otherwise Its Fourier transform is F(ω) = ∫ T 2 − T 2 be−jωtdt = − b jω [e−jωt] T 2 − T 2 = 27 / 28 Introduction Mathematical Formulation The Gaussian Take a ‘Gaussian’ shaped pulse: f(t) = e−a2t2 The Fourier transform of this is: F(ω) = In words, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian shape is itself a Gaussian shape - see probability and statistics course where this result is derived.
