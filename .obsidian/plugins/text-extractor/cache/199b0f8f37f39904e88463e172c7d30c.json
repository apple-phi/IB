What are the physical interpretations of the generalized momenta and forces? (b) Show than an exactly analogous Lagrangian arrises for a system of two disks (I1 and I2) and two matching torsional springs, leading to the same equations of motion for the disks’ angular displacements θ1 and θ2. What now are the physical interpretations of the generalized momenta and forces? (c) Show that these equations of motion agree with those obtained by directly considering forces on the two masses or torques on the two disks. 5 A satellite has position r and θ in a plane-polar coordinate system centered on Earth.

Physically, what is the generalized momenta for zc? (c) Find and solve the Lagrangian equations of motion for zc and zs, and hence describe the toy’s motion whilst it jumps.

Friction is negligible, the puck never leaves the surface, and you may assume height variations are small compared to the length of the pitch, so you can ignore the kinetic energy associated with vertical motion. x h(x) Δh (a) Categorize the different types of motion the puck can undergo, and sketch (in x–y 2-D coordinates) the different types of motion as seen from above. (b) The puck is launched in the top ﬂat region towards the bottom ﬂat region. If it is launched at speed vi and making an angle θi with the x axis, what angle, θf , will it be moving at when it is in the lower ﬂat region. 9 * A wire hoop spins around a vertical diameter at ﬁxed angular velocity ω.
