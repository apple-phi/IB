Devices: Metallisation & Materials Characterisation https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69961 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 2 Metallisation • Metals perform vital functions in semiconductor devices • Their high conductivity allows them to be used to make electrical contacts in situations where the conductivity of a doped semiconductor is insufficient • They are usually used to make conducting tracks and vias to devices • In some cases they can also be used to form electrical devices with semiconductors (e.g. metal- semiconductor diodes called Schottky Diodes) • From a mechanical perspective, metals generally possess high strength and ductility, even at elevated temperatures • We do not need the same degree of process control as for semiconductors, typically, and so there is a greater emphasis on low cost and high volume manufacture 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 3 Evaporation • Thermal evaporation is a popular method for producing thin metallic layers due to its simplicity • The metal to be deposited is placed on a metal filament (normally W or Mo with a much higher melting point) inside a vacuum chamber which is held at a pressure below 10-4 Pa • A current is passed through the filament, which heats up causing the metal to evaporate • The flux of atoms evaporating per second, F, is given by 𝐹𝐹 = 𝑁𝑁0exp −𝜙𝜙𝑒𝑒 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 • where N0 is a slowly varying function of temperature and φe is the activation energy required to evaporate one molecule which is related to the enthalpy of formation of the evaporant, H, by 𝜙𝜙𝑒𝑒 = 𝐻𝐻 𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴 • The substrate is placed a short distance away from the evaporating metal, and any molecules which hit the substrate will condense (10.1) (10.2) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 4 • A high vacuum is required in thermal evaporation to ensure than contamination of the metal layer is minimised • The source to substrate distance should be small compared with the mean free path in the vacuum • The time required for a monolayer of the residual vacuum material to hit the substrate surface should be long compared with the time for a monolayer of material to be

short for monolayer – one layer of atoms) • The substrate to sample distance is normally 0.2 – 0.5 m to avoid excessive radiative heating of the sample • Therefore, working pressures below ~10-4 Pa are required • Gases (such as O2) may however be purposefully added at high pressure to produce metal oxides Air Pressure [Pa] Mean Free Path [m] Impingement rate [s-1 m-2] Time for 1 ML exposure [s]

Evaporation results in ‘line of sight’ deposition from what is essentially a point source of evaporating metal • Therefore, the deposition rate, R, at a distance d from the source is given by 𝑅𝑅 ∝ cos 𝛽𝛽 cos 𝜃𝜃 𝑑𝑑2 • where angles are as defined in the figure • Evaporation therefore gives very poor step edge coverage, which is frequently a problem (although can occasionally be put to good use) and films are non- uniform over large areas d β θ substrate source Heater AFM Image of a 2µm×2µm×40nm thermally evaporated gold layer on mica (10.3) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 7 • Evaporation produces generally amorphous metallic layers, frequently with a high surface roughness • The kinetic energy associated with depositing atoms is very low (~0.1 eV) so there is little possibility of damage to underlying layers, although thermal damage can occur • In addition to resistive heating of a filament (which can be a source of contamination) other methods of evaporating metals are employed • Electron beam (e-beam) • An e-beam locally melts a metal in a crucible • The crucible is not exposed to the melt, and contamination is reduced • X-rays can be emitted by the impacting electrons, resulting in radiation damage of the sample (and operator?!) • Laser heating • A very expensive, but low contamination option • rf induction heating 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 8 Sputtering • Sputtering has become probably the most popular method for producing metallic layers • The basic principle behind sputter coating is that ions of an inert gas are fired at a block of the desired source material (the target) under vacuum • An incident ion passes its kinetic energy to atoms at or near the target surface, allowing them to escape into the vacuum • The substrate to be coated is placed a short distance away from the target • Any released atoms hitting the substrate will condense and form the desired coating 1 2 3 4 5 6 Sputter target

Transparency 9 • There are several means by which the incident ions may be generated • Application of a high, negative dc voltage to the target with respect to a nearby anode creates a plasma discharge, although this can only be employed for conducting targets • Application of an rf electric field to the target also produces a plasma discharge, but the rf electric field will not be screened by any insulating surface to the target, allowing the sputtering of insulators such as SiO2 • Furthermore, a magnetic field may be used to guide ions onto the target to improve the sputter rate • This technique is known as rf magnetron sputtering and is particularly versatile • The addition of oxygen or nitrogen gas to the argon will cause the formation of a metal oxide or nitride insulator, such as TiN or Al2O3, and this is called reactive sputtering, whilst alloys can be formed by sputtering an alloy target or sputtering from several targets simultaneously 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 10 • In order to impart a significant kinetic energy to the target, a relatively massive inert gas atom is required, and Ar is most frequently employed • The sputter yield is defined as the number of atoms removed per incident ion • Most metals have a sputter yield of ~1 for Ar ions in the energy range 500 to 3000 eV • The sputter yield, S, is dependent on several factors 1. Ion type 2. Target material 3. Ion energy • A minimum ion energy in the range of 10 to 30 eV (the sputter threshold) is required for any release of target material • The yield then increases linearly with energy up to ~1 keV 4. Angle of incidence • At glancing angles, there is negligible sputtering yield • Yield then increases rapidly up to a maximum at an angle of Θmax before slowly decreasing towards normal incidence 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 11 • The large area of the target (typically similar to the substrate) leads to improved step coverage and uniformity relative to evaporation • However, sputtering is a more costly process to implement, whilst secondary electron bombardment of the sample can lead to excessive sample heating as well as defect creation • The latter of these means that semiconductors produced by this technique are usually of poor quality • Argon may also be incorporated into the substrate, leading to a porous sample • Finally, the deposition rate, R, by sputtering can be very slow (normally well below 1 nm s-1) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 12 Electroplating • Electroplating is the application of metallic coatings to conductive surfaces by electrochemical processes • The sample to be coated, which must have a conductive surface, is placed in a solution of the metal salt to be deposited together with another conducting plate and these are connected as the cathode and anode respectively to a low voltage, dc power supply • In aqueous solution, the metal salt will dissociate, as will the water to a small extent • For example, for the plating of copper using copper sulphate, CuSO4 → Cu2+ + SO42- H2O ↔ H+ + OH- • Under the application of a bias to the electrodes, the positive ions will migrate to the cathode 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 13 • The metal ions will be deposited onto the electrode surface while the H+ ions will mostly react to form gaseous hydrogen, although a small quantity may be incorporated into the metal • The reaction at the anode will depend on its nature • For an inert anode, the hydroxyl ions will be discharged, 4OH- - 4e- → 2H2O + O2 (gas) • As the anode is inert, the salt ions cannot react and so are not discharged • This has the disadvantage that the metal ion is depleted from the solution with time • Alternatively, the anode may be made from the depositing metal, in which case it will be dissolved into the solution in preference to any other electrochemical reactions at low voltages • For example, the reaction at a copper anode will be Cu (anode) – 2e- → Cu2+ • From the Faraday Law of electrolysis, the mass of metal deposited per unit area per unit time, M, is given by 𝑀𝑀 = 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 𝑍𝑍𝐹𝐹 • where, assuming 100% current efficiency, J is the current density due to metal ions, A and z are the atomic weight and valency of the metal respectively and F is the Faraday constant, which is 96500 C • If the density of the layer is ρ, then a thickness R of material will be deposited in one second (deposition rate) where 𝑅𝑅 = ⁄𝑀𝑀 𝜌𝜌 (10.4) (10.5) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 14 Transparent Conducting Oxides • Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) area class of optically transparent materials which nevertheless do conduct electricity • The most common TCO is tin doped indium oxide (more usually, but ambiguously called indium tin oxide, ITO) • It has a band gap of 3.75 eV, allowing visible radiation to pass • It has a low electron mobility (~1×10-3 m2 V-1 s-1) and so must be heavily doped to yield a reasonable conductivity • Provides a means of providing optically transparent contacts and is most frequently employed in solar cells • TCO may be deposited by reactively sputtering indium and tin in an oxygen environment • More simply, the alloy of the correct composition may be purchased as a target and used in an rf sputtering system with little process development • Electroplating has been applied to the production of high aspect ratio structures 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 15 Characterisation Techniques • The fabrication of a typical electronic device involves many process steps and several materials • A failure at any stage in the fabrication process can lead to complete device failure • It is therefore imperative to have the ability to characterise individual materials and process steps so that the cause of device failure can be rapidly determined • In general, this material characterisation can be classified into one of three groups 1. Microscopy 2. Physical Characterisation • E.g. x-ray diffraction 3.

A. Hopcroft, M. Phil Thesis (2002) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 20 X-Ray DIffraction • X-rays (high energy photons) have a wavelength that is of the same order as the interatomic spacing (~0.1 – 1 nm) • When a coherent source of x-rays is incident on a crystal, reflection will take place from each of the atomic layers, leading to the formation of a diffraction pattern • The Bragg equation for diffraction states that constructive interference will only occur when 𝑛𝑛𝐶𝐶 = 2𝑑𝑑 sin 𝜃𝜃 • where n is an integer, d is the lattice spacing and θ is the angle of incidence • Diffraction can occur from any set of planes • A plane is defined by its Miller indices (h k l): the number of times the plane cuts each side of the unit cell • Therefore, for a given set of planes (h k l) in a cubic unit cell with side lengths a, b and c, the plane separation in equation 10.8 will be 1 𝑑𝑑2 = ℎ2 𝑎𝑎2+ 𝑘𝑘2 𝑏𝑏2+ 𝑙𝑙2 𝑐𝑐2 (10.8) (10.9) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 21 • We would therefore expect to see a set of diffraction peaks associated with each combination of h, k and l • However, crystals are rarely simple and additional atoms within each unit cell will affect the diffraction pattern • We need to introduce a structure factor, Fhkl, the modulus of which gives the amplitude of the wave diffracted by a particular set of planes, and is given by 𝐹𝐹ℎ𝑘𝑘𝑙𝑙 = � 1 𝑁𝑁 𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛 exp 2𝜋𝜋j ℎ𝑢𝑢𝑛𝑛 + 𝑘𝑘𝑣𝑣𝑛𝑛 + 𝑙𝑙𝑤𝑤𝑛𝑛 • where un, vn and wn are the fractional positions of the atoms in the unit cell and f is the scattering factor for the particular atom • Hence for a face centred cubic atomic structure with identical atoms at positions (0 0 0), (½ ½ 0), (½ 0 ½) and (0 ½ ½) we find a structure factor of 𝐹𝐹ℎ𝑘𝑘𝑙𝑙 = 𝑓𝑓 exp 2𝜋𝜋j 0 + 𝑓𝑓 exp 2𝜋𝜋j ℎ 2 + 𝑘𝑘 2 + 𝑓𝑓 exp 2𝜋𝜋j ℎ 2 + 𝑙𝑙 2 + 𝑓𝑓 exp 2𝜋𝜋j 𝑘𝑘 2 + 𝑙𝑙 2 𝐹𝐹ℎ𝑘𝑘𝑙𝑙 = 𝑓𝑓 1 + exp 𝜋𝜋j ℎ + 𝑘𝑘 + exp 𝜋𝜋j ℎ + 𝑙𝑙 + exp 𝜋𝜋j 𝑘𝑘 + 𝑙𝑙 • If h, k and l are all odd or all even, then F = 4f and there will be a diffraction peak associated with this plane • However, if they are mixed odd and even, then F = 0 and there will be no diffraction peak • Hence peaks associated with (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes will be present, whilst those associated with (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 2) will not (10.10) (10.11) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 10 – Transparency 22 • In this way, XRD allows a determination of the lattice parameters and structure • A single crystal will produce a pattern of spots • In polycrystalline materials, as all crystal orientations are generally present, diffraction rings are produced, and so X-ray intensity may simply be plotted as a function of angle, as for the microcrystalline silicon sample shown above • In amorphous materials, broad, diffuse rings are produced • If the material possesses an intrinsic stress, then the crystal lattice will be distorted, and this results in a well- defined broadening of the diffraction peaks as a function of (h k l), allowing the stress to be measured • A number of different X-ray diffraction techniques exist to permit a range of microstructural properties to be investigated S.
