Note that notation and conventions differ slightly between the various books and that used in this course. McLellan et al. introduces the discrete theory before the continuous theory, while in this course we do the continuous theory and lead on to the discrete theory.

Signals and data are continuously being generated and measured in all walks of life, e.g. • Mobile phones record and generate sounds, images and video. They then analyse and code the data for eﬀicient storage or for wireless transmission. • In engineering environments signals can involve measurements of vibrations from mechanical structures, recording of speech or audio data, data from patient monitoring machines in hospitals, measurements of natural phenomena (temperatures, tide heights, emissions from distant galaxies....). . 7 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Motivation cont... • One of the most important tasks in analysing and processing of these signals is to determine which frequency components are present in the data. • You already have some methods for analysing frequency content: • Fourier Series - but only applicable for periodic and continuous-time waveforms • Frequency response of linear system - more applicable, but we need to analyse signals as well as systems This course will introduce new concepts in frequency analysis which allow you to determine the frequency content of general (non-periodic) signals, in both continuous-time (‘analogue’) and discrete-time (‘digital’). 8 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Motivation cont... Nowadays data will mostly be measured in digital form and often processed by computers. This gives many advantages, including repeatability, guaranteed levels of accuracy, flexibility and power of processing. In this course we will also study the basics of digital signal processing, including the principles of digital sampling.For example, we will study a classic result – The Nyquist Sampling Theorem – which shows that it is possible to reconstruct an original analogue signal perfectly from correctly digitised data [ recall (??) the debate over changing from LPs to CDs in the 80s]. 9 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Examples of Data We may have to deal with data which is • continuous or discrete • real or complex / scalar or vector valued • deterministic or random • periodic or non-periodic 10 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Power and Energy We define the total energy content of a signal f(t) as follows: Ef = ∫ +∞ −∞ |f(t)|2dt Often more convenient to compute as a limit: Ef = lim T→∞ ∫ +T/2 −T/2 |f(t)|2dt 11 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited and similarly the average power content of the signal is defined as Pf = lim T→∞ 1 T ∫ T/2 −T/2 |f(t)|2dt. (1) Note that Pf is the average power of the signal estimated over the whole time interval 12 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Example: Consider a decaying exponential signal f(t), where f(t) = { exp(−t) t > 0 0 t ≤ 0 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 8 −0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Figure 1: The function: e−t for t > 0, and 0 for t ≤ 0 Calculate the energy for this function Energy : ∫ ∞ 0 |e−t|2dt = ∫ ∞ 0 e−2tdt = − 1 2 [exp(−2t)]∞ 0 = 1 2 13 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Consider now the power of this function: Power : lim T→∞ 1 T ∫ T/2 0 e−2tdt = lim T→∞ −1 2T [e−2t]T/2 0 −→ 0 We see here therefore that while the average energy for this signal is well defined, the average power is zero and is therefore not a helpful quantity in this case. Looking at the form for energy it is reasonable to suppose that we might run into problems when we consider a signal such as a sine wave which does not decay as t −→ ∞. 14 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Example: Consider the signal f(t) = sin(t) : −6 −4 −2 0 2 4 6 −2 −1.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 Now try to evaluate the energy in this signal. First look at the energy in just one half-period of sine, from 0 to π: ∫ π 0 | sin(t)|2dt = 1 2 ∫ π 0 (1 − cos(2t))dt = 1 2 [t − 1 2 sin(2t)]π 0 = π 2 15 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Now, the total energy involves adding together the energy of all of the half-period intervals: ∫ ∞ −∞ | sin(t)|2dt = n=+∞ ∑ n=−∞ ∫ (n+1)π nπ | sin(t)|2dt = +∞ ∑ n=−∞ π/2−→ ∞ and the energy is therefore infinite. But, is the power well-defined? 16 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Evaluating power in this signal gives: lim T→∞ 1 T ∫ T/2 −T/2 | sin(t)|2dt = lim T→∞ 1 2T [t − sin(2t)/2]T/2 −T/2 = lim T→∞ 1 2T [T − sin(T)] = lim T→∞ 1 2 [1 − sin(T) T ] = 1 2 . Power is therefore well-defined. We should therefore be aware that the nature of the signal determines whether it is the energy or the power that is the useful quantity to deal with. 17 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited δ-functions revisited δ-functions (also known as the Dirac δ-function or the impulse function) are fundamental to the understanding of signal analysis. Consider the rectangular pulse f1(t ; ϵ), where ϵ can vary from 0 to ∞, illustrated below; −ϵ/2 ϵ/2 1/ϵ t The pulse is designed such that it has unit area, i.e. ∫ ∞ −∞ f1(t ; ϵ)dt = 1, for all ϵ > 0 18 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited The δ-function, δ(t) can be defined as a limiting case: {f1(t; ϵ)} as ϵ → 0: δ(t) = lim ϵ→0 f1(t ; ϵ). (2) Two familiar properties are a) δ(t) = 0 for t ̸= 0. b) ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(t)dt = 1. 19 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited The sifting property Now consider the following integral ∫ ∞ −∞ g(t)δ(t − a)dt. a δ(t − a) t g(t) 20 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Since δ(t − a) is zero for all values of t except t = a, we have: ∫ ∞ −∞ g(t)δ(t − a)dt = ∫ ∞ −∞ g(a)δ(t − a)dt = g(a) ∫ ∞ −∞ δ(t − a)dt = g(a). We therefore have the VERY USEFUL result that integrating a function with δ(t − a) picks out the value of the function at a: ∫ +∞ −∞ g(t)δ(t − a)dt = g(a) This will be referred to as the Sifting Property 21 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Other definitions of the delta function The delta-function can be defined as limiting cases of other functions as well as the family of rectangular pulses f1(t; ϵ) considered above. Consider for example the two functions: f2(t ; ϵ) = ϵ ϵ2π2 + t2 f3(t ; a) = sin(at) πt 22 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited It can be shown that we can also produce a delta function using f2 or f3: δ(t) = lim ϵ→0 f2(t ; ϵ) = lim a→∞ f3(t ; a) Let us concentrate on the family of functions f3(t ; a). The function sin(t)/t, is known as the sinc function or sinc(t), which oscillates like a sine-wave, but decays to zero as t goes to ±∞, see figure 2. −50 −40 −30 −20 −10 0 10 20 30 40 50 −0.4 −0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 sin(t)/t t Figure 2: The sinc function sin(t)/t 23 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited Its integral (not derived here) is equal to π: ∫ +∞ −∞ sin(t) t dt = π (3) Hence, integrating by substitution, the pulse f3(t ; a) has area 1, as required. Now see figure 3 to see sin(at) πt converging to a δ-function. 24 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited −50 0 50 −0.5 0 0.5 1 −50 0 50 −1 0 1 2 −50 0 50 −2 0 2 4 −50 0 50 −5 0 5 10 −50 0 50 −10 0 10 20 −50 0 50 −20 0 20 40 −50 0 50 −50 0 50 −50 0 50 −50 0 50 100 a=1 a=2 a=4 a=8 a=16 a=32 a=64 a=128 Figure 3: sin(at) πt for various values of a 25 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited A useful integral We can use the previous result to evaluate the following integral, which will be used several times later in the course: I = ∫ ∞ −∞ exp(jωt)dω = lim A→∞ ∫ A −A exp(jωt)dω (4) Standard integration gives I = lim A→∞ [ ejωt jt ]A −A = lim A→∞ (2 sin(At) t ) = lim A→∞ 2πf3(t; A) = 2πδ(t) (5) where the last line follows from the definition of the δ-function as the limit of a sequence of functions f3() (see previous section). 26 / 27 Introduction Power and Energy δ-functions Revisited This gives the useful result: lim A→∞ ∫ A −A ejωtdω = 2πδ(t) (6) or ∫ ∞ −∞ exp(jωt)dω = 2πδ(t) (7) 27 / 27","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
