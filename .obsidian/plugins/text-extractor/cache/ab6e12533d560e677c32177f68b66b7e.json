Tonometry [Biomechanics as a diagnostic tool] Fluid: Fluids in the eye Fluid type: blood flow; aqueous humour; interstitial flow in ECM; • No vasculature in the lens and cornea to ensure transparency – the aqueous humour nourishes these regions. • Blood transports oxygen and nutrients, taking away waste products. • Choroid has highest perfused volume of any tissue in body – high metabolism needed to detect photons. • Interstitial fluids: fluids contained in all tissue spaces and pores 7 8 Blood flow in the eye • “Starling resistor”: - Pressure falls along vessel due to pipe friction • Unique blood flow system in eye. • Blood transports oxygen and nutrients, taking away waste products. • Choroid has highest perfused volume of any tissue in body – high metabolism needed to detect photons. Artery pressure (e.g.75/35 mmHg) Venous pressure (8-10 mmHg) Blood flow Bernoulli's principle, rigid pipe [Model simplifications; assumptions] Blood flow in the eye • “Starling resistor”: - Pressure falls along vessel due to pipe friction - Collapse of blood vessel under external pressure causes constriction - Constriction controls flow, with no effect of downstream pressure on flow - Compares with supersonic throat or waterfall – hence termed vascular waterfall - Net effect: flow controlled by IOP rather than venous pressure - Need to autoregulate flow to cope with differences in IOP.

Lamina cribrosa, neural cells digested away Mechanics of Glaucoma • Significant deformation of LC due to IOP seen in experiments • Models hampered by uncertainty in material properties. • Results from finite element (FE) analysis highlight importance of scleral modulus.

Can these strains arise in the LC? • Assume that modulus of LC is much less than that of the sclera (c.f. foams, relative density r*/rs =0.1  E*/Es = 10-3) • Biaxial remote stresses.
