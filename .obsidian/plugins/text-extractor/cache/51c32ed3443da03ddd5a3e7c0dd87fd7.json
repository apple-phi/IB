Recall that: • Transmitter does encoding & modulation • Receiver does demodulation & decoding • The user is allocated a channel of bandwidth B What if there are many users needing to communicate to the receiver using the same channel bandwidth? • How do they share the channel? • This is the problem of multiple access 2 / 20 Multiple-user communication is a typical scenario in wireless networks, cellular communication 3 / 20 Multiple Access: The Main Ideas Imagine that five of you (multiple users) each have a question to ask me (receiver). What techniques can we use, such that I understand all questions? • One after the other, each using the whole bandwidth for a fraction of the time. This is called time-division multiple access • All at the same time, but each with a different frequency. This is called frequency-division multiple access. (Each user communicates all the time using using a fraction of the available bandwidth) • All at the same time using the whole bandwidth, each with a different signature, i.e., a different language (known to the receiver). This is called code-division multiple access These three techniques are abbreviated as TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, respectively 4 / 20 We can think of each multiple-access technique as dividing up a “box” among the users, by cutting along different axes B Signature Time Frequency Tf 5 / 20 Time Division Multiple Access In TDMA, multiple users are multiplexed in time, so that they transmit one after the other, using the whole bandwidth B. • Each of K users gets one slot in a frame of duration Tf • K time slots in a frame, each of duration Tu = Tf K . . .

Communication channels can be modelled as linear systems (filters) + noise. If we communicate over a frequency band where the channel frequency response is flat, then we get an additive noise channel. 3. Analogue Communication: continuous-time information signal x(t) directly modulates the carrier • Variants of Amplitude Modulation: Power, bandwidth, receiver structures • FM: Constant power but requires larger bandwidth than AM; Carson’s rule for FM bandwidth; more robust to noise 4. Digitisation: To convert an analogue source x(t) (e.g., speech/music) to digital: x(t) sampling −→ {x(nT )}n∈Z quantisation −→ . . . 0100111 . . .

Modulation: Converting bits into a waveform suitable for transmission over the channel – PAM for baseband: Tx & Rx structures, bandwidth, power, performance analysis (probability of detection error) – QAM for passband: more bandwidth-efficient than PAM 6. Coding: Adding redundancy to source bits to make them robust to channel errors – An (N, K ) block code: K source bits −→ N code bits (N > K ) – Two simple block codes: (N, 1) repetition code and (7, 4) Hamming code 18 / 20 To conclude, Information Engineering is about: • Communication: Representing information compactly, and transmitting it reliably over noisy channels • Signal Processing : Algorithms to extract clean signals from noisy data (e.g. GPS, medical imaging) • Control: E.g., gyroscope in your phone, auto-pilot in an aircraft, autonomous driving • Statistical Inference & Machine Learning: Extracting and learning essential features from data to make useful predictions.
