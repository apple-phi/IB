When biological functions can be ‘substituted’ by engineering devices? • How to reduce system complexity for problem solving and to gain mechanistic insights? • Define the problem/ research question/ system → Why? • What is the broader impact?

The (crystalline) lens sits behind the iris and contributes the remainder (1/3) of the eye’s focusing power. The focal distance of the eye is altered by changing the shape of the lens via the action of the ciliary muscles. 5 6 • In biology, extracellular matrix (ECM) is any material part of a tissue that is not part of any cells • Extracellular matrix dominance is the defining feature of connective tissue. • Most connective tissues are: – Involved in structure and support. – Physical properties characterized largely by the non-living constituent. – Examples: bone, cartilage, ligaments and tendons; cornea and sclera. epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue Collagen Proteoglycans nucleus cell Little of extracellular material connective tissue cell nucleus Lots of extracellular material ▪ Tissues: functional building block of an organ ▪ Tissues consist of Cells & ECM (structured living materials) Connective Tissue Cells, proteins, sugars 7 8 Collagen Collagen fibre bundle in sclera Protein (polypeptide) Molecule Cornea Collagen fibrils • Parallel bundles of similar size in cornea contribute to transparency • Sclera characterized by more random web. • Low levels of interweaving between layers. • Low solid density random gel network gives structural properties and transparency of vitreous • Similarity with synthetic textiles. Sclera SEM In section Schematic of the vitreous space Hyaluronic acid Collagen fibrils 9 10 Tissues in The Eye: Cornea Cells Collagen and some sugars Cells In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5 mm and a thickness of 0.5–0.6 mm in the centre and 0.6–0.8 mm at the periphery. There is no blood supply to the cornea. Anatomy of cornea A cornea has 3 main parts. • Stroma has 90% of total thickness and contributes to its toughness & transparency • Collagen fibres + sugar-protein + water Stroma (500 μm) Epithelium (50 μm) Endothelium (5 μm) Collagen fibres (30 nm) Sugar-protein ground substance 11 12 Corneal collagen Collagen fibres (30 nm) Sugar-protein ground substance Corneal collagen is crystalline • The collagen fibril diameter is nearly constant • The collagen fibril spacing is regular (and nearly perfect) • Collagen packing → function refraction index of n = 1.376 Cornea: Real collagen fibrils in cross-section (TEM) K: corneal keratocyte (fibroblast) 13 14 Cornea: Collagen fiber → composite design of load bearing but light-weight Collagen fibrils in SEM (Top view). Side view = Top view (basket weave) Alignment of Corneal Collagen Fibrils • The fibril orientation in the left and right eyes are mirror images • Pattern of fibrils provides support to the cornea • Basket weave structure in the central region of the cornea • Fibrils are directed towards extra-ocular muscles at the edges 15 16 Front Back The cornea and sclera are typical soft connective tissues in the body. The lens capsule is also a typical connective tissue with collagens and sugars. It varies in thickness. Directly beneath the capsule is a layer of epithelial cells. These cells are a source for the cortex and nucleus of new lens fibres which have a specialized structure. The lens is about 10mm in diameter and 3.5-5mm thick at its centre. Zonular fibres close to the capsule Capsule Lens fibres Epithelium (transition zone) Tissues in The Eye: Crystalline Lens Crystalline Lens The bulk of the lens, the cortex (newer fibres) and the nucleus (older fibres), is cellular. These specialized cells are the “lens fibres” and they are vastly elongated lens epithelial cells that have lost most of the normal cell contents (nucleus and organelles). The lens is 30% protein by mass and the proteins are the very unusual “crystallins”. Zonular fibres close to the capsule Capsule Epithelium (transition zone) Lens fibres 17 18 As with the cornea, a large degree of organization is found in the lens and this gives rise to its optical transparency (in a manner that is actually not understood very well). The overall layered structure of the lens fibres is often compared to the layers of an onion. In common with the cornea there are no blood vessels in the lens. Lens Structure Physical function of the lens: focusing Measuring material properties of the eyemicroscopic Macroscopic Difficult to measure biological material properties for a variety of reasons - small features/inhomogeneity - inconvenient shape - anisotropy - complex loading - time-dependence - specimen/person variability - species variability - in vitro behaviour not representative of in vivo - ethical/practical procurement problems Sometimes approximate values are adequate 19 20 Structure (anatomy) Loading conditions State of the material: functions, deformation, failure Material (living; passive vs. reactive) Measuring material properties of the eye • When to apply Engineering concepts? • How to reduce system complexity for problem solving and to gain mechanistic insights?
