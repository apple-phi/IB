If the average heat transfer coefficient is 800 𝑊 𝑚2.℃, determine the length of the tube in order to heat the water to 115℃ (see the figure). Solution: Water is heated by steam in a circular tube. The tube length required to heat the water to a specified temperature is to be determined. Assumptions: 1- Steady operating conditions exit 2- Fluid properties are constant 3- The convection heat transfer coefficient is constant 4- The conduction resistance of copper tube is negligible so that the inner surface temperature of the tube is equal to the condensation temperature of steam. Properties The specific heat of water at the bulk mean temperature of (15+115)/2=65℃ is 4187 J/kg.℃. The heat of condensation of steam at 120℃ is 2203 kJ/kg. Analysis Knowing the inlet and exit temperatures of water, the rate of heat transfer is determined to be 𝑄̇ = 𝑚 ̇ 𝑐𝑝(𝑇𝑒 − 𝑇𝑖) = (0.3 𝑘𝑔 𝑠 ) (4.187 𝑘𝐽 𝑘𝑔℃ ) (115℃ − 15℃) = 125.6𝑘𝑊 The logarithmic mean temperature difference is ∆𝑇𝑒 = 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑒=120℃ − 115℃ = 5℃ ∆𝑇𝑖 = 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑖=120℃ − 15℃ = 105℃ ∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 = ∆𝑇𝑒 − ∆𝑇𝑖 ln ( 5 105) = 5 − 105 ln (5/105) = 32.85℃ The heat transfer surface area is 𝑄̇ = ℎ𝐴𝑠∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 → 𝐴𝑠 = 𝑄̇ ℎ∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 = 125.6 𝑘𝑊 (0.8 𝑘𝑊 𝑚2. ℃)(32.85℃) = 4.78𝑚2 Then the required tube length becomes 2 𝐴𝑠 = 𝜋𝐷𝐿 → 𝐿 = 𝐴𝑠 𝜋𝐷 = 4.78 𝑚2 𝜋(0.025𝑚) = 61𝑚 Discussion: The bulk mean temperature of water during this heating process is 65℃, and thus the arithmetic mean temperature difference is ∆𝑇𝑎𝑚 =120-65=55℃. Using ∆𝑇𝑎𝑚 instead of ∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 would give L= 36m, which is grossly in error. This shows the importance of using the logarithmic mean temperature in calculations. 2- Compare the hydrodynamic and thermal entry lengths of mercury (liquid metal) and a light oil flowing at 3.0 mm/s in a 25.0 mm diameter smooth tube at a bulk temperature of 750C. The pertinent parameters of the fluids at that temperature are: 𝑣𝐻𝑔=1.0 × 10−7 m 2/s, 𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑙=6.5 × 10−6 m 2/s, 𝑃𝑟𝐻𝑔 = 0.019, 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑖𝑙 = 85. Solution: The Reynolds numbers based on the tube diameters are: 𝑅𝑒𝐻𝑔 = 𝑉𝐷 𝑣𝐻𝑔 = (3.0 × 10−3𝑚/𝑠)(25.0 × 10−3𝑚) 1.0 × 10−7 𝑚2/𝑠 = 750 𝑅𝑒𝑜𝑖𝑙 = 𝑉𝐷 𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑙 = (3.0 × 10−3𝑚/𝑠)(25.0 × 10−3𝑚) 6.5 × 10−6 𝑚2/𝑠 = 11.53 The hydrodynamic entry lengths are given by ( 𝑥𝑓𝑑,ℎ 𝐷 ) ≈ 0.05𝑅𝑒𝐷 so 𝑥ℎ,𝐻𝑔 ≈ (0.05)(750)(25.0𝑚𝑚) = 937.5 𝑚𝑚 𝑥ℎ,𝑜𝑖𝑙 ≈ (0.05)(11.53)(25.0𝑚𝑚) = 14.4 𝑚𝑚 For the thermal entry lengths, ( 𝑥𝑓𝑑,𝑡 𝐷 )𝑙𝑎𝑚 ≈ 0.05𝑅𝑒𝐷𝑃𝑟 𝑥𝑡,𝐻𝑔 ≈ (0.05)(750)(0.019)(25.0𝑚𝑚) = 17.8 𝑚𝑚 𝑥𝑡,𝑜𝑖𝑙 ≈ (0.05)(11.53)(85)(25.0𝑚𝑚) = 1225 𝑚𝑚 Note the short thermal entry of mercury compared to its hydrodynamic entry lengths. What has caused this significant difference? 3- For heating water from 20°C to 60°C an electrically heated tube resulting in a constant heat flux of 10 kW/m 2 is proposed. The mass flow rate is to be such that ReD=2000, and consequently the flow must remain laminar. The tube inside diameter is 25mm. The flow is fully developed (velocity profile). Determine (a) the length of tube required and (b) if thus proposed heating system is feasible with regard to wall temperature. Solution We first calculate the average temperature which is 𝑇̅ ℎ=20+60 2 °𝐶=40℃ The thermo-physical properties should be evaluated (from the table) at this average temperature 𝜌 = 994.6 𝑘𝑔 𝑚3 𝐶𝑝 = 4.1784 𝑘𝐽 𝑘𝑔.𝐾 3 Pr=4.34 k= 0.628 W/m.K 𝜈=0.658× 10−6 𝑚2/𝑠 (a) The required tube length is obtained by an energy balance, i.e., 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝(𝑇𝑏,𝑜 − 𝑇𝑏,𝑖) = 𝑞′′(𝐴𝑠) To determine 𝑚̇ we need to know the bulk velocity. Since 𝑅𝑒𝐷 = 2000, 𝐷𝑉 𝜈 = 2000; 𝑉 = 2000 𝑣 𝐷 = 2000(0.658×10−6 𝑚2/𝑠) 0.025 𝑚 = 0.0526 𝑚/𝑠 and 𝑚̇ 𝐶𝑝=𝜌𝑉 ( 𝜋𝐷2 4 ) (𝑐𝑝) = ( 994.6 𝑘𝑔 𝑚3 ) (0.0526 𝑚 𝑠 ) ( 𝜋 4) × (0.025 𝑚)2 (4178 𝐽 𝑘𝑔.𝐾) = 107.3 𝑊/𝐾 Rearranging expression (i) we have 𝐴𝑠=𝜋𝐷𝐿𝑞 ′′ =𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝(𝑇𝑏,𝑜 − 𝑇𝑏,𝑖); 𝐿 = 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝(𝑇𝑏,𝑜−𝑇𝑏,𝑖) 𝜋𝐷𝑞,, Inserting numerical values with 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝 from expression (ii) yields 𝐿 = (107.3 𝑊/𝐾)(60°𝐶−20℃) 𝜋(0.025𝑚)(10000 𝑊/𝑚2) = 5.46 𝑚 (b) Is this flow feasible? Is the wall temperature realistic? With the flow being hydrodynamically fully developed, we check the length of the thermal entry section given by 𝑥𝑡,𝑓𝑑 = 0.05𝑅𝑒𝐷𝑃𝑟𝐷 = 0.05(2000)(4.34)(0.025m)=10.85m and clearly this is a case of constant 𝑞′′; developed velocity and developing thermal profile. The Nusselt number may be obtained from the Figures below The inverse of Graetz number at the exit is 𝐺𝑧−1 = (𝑥 𝐷) 𝑅𝑒𝐷𝑃𝑟 = (5.46 𝑚/0.025𝑚)/ (2000)(4.34)=0.0252=2.52× 10−2 and reading the dashed line for constant surface heat flux in the figure above, Nu=5.0 4 where this is the local value at the tube exit where the wall temperature will be maximum. Hence, ℎ = 𝑘 𝐷 𝑁𝑢𝐷 = (0.628 𝑊 𝑚𝐾. 0.025 𝑚 ) (5.0) = 125.6 𝑊 𝑚2.𝑘 Then with known 𝑞′′, 𝑇𝑏,𝑖 and h, the exit plane surface temperature is 𝑞′′ = ℎ(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑏,𝑜); 𝑇𝑠=𝑞,, ℎ + 𝑇𝑏,𝑜 𝑇𝑠 = 10 𝑘𝑊 𝑚2 ( 1 125.6 𝑊 𝑚2.𝐾) + 60℃ 𝑇𝑠 = 139.6℃ ≈ 412 𝐾 This is slightly high temperature for the wall material. If necessary, the wall heat flux could be reduced thereby lengthening the tube, increasing the Greatz-1number, and lowering 𝑁𝑢𝐷 and h very slightly. The 𝑇𝑠 is more affected by the 𝑞′′ than the h, for example a 50% reduction in 𝑞′′ would lower 𝑇𝑠,𝑜 by approximetly 35℃. 4-Air at 1.0 atmosphere pressure and 77°C enters a 5.0 mm i.d. tube with a bulk average velocity of 2.5 m/s. The velcoity profile is developed and the thermal profile is “developing”. The tube length is 1.0 m, and a constant (uniform) heat flux is imposed by the tube surface on the air over the entire length. An exit air bulk average temperature, Th.o=127°C, is required. Determine (a) the exit h value, hL, (b) the uniform qs’’, and (c) the exit tube surface temperature. We will need air properties at the bulk average temperature inside the tube, 𝑇𝑏,𝑖+𝑇𝑏,𝑜 2 = (77+127) 2 = 102℃=375 K From property tables we obtain 𝜌 = 0.9403 𝑘𝑔/𝑚3 𝑐𝑝 = 1.0115 𝑘𝐽 𝑘𝑔. 𝐾 𝜇 = 2.1805 × 10−5 Kg/m.s 𝜈 = 23.33 × 10−6 𝑚2/𝑠 k= 0.03184 W/m.K Pr=0.693 The Reynolds number is 𝑅𝑒𝐷 = 𝐷𝑉 𝑣 = (0.005 𝑚)(2.5 𝑚/𝑠) 23.33×10−6 𝑚2/𝑠 =536 and the flow is laminar. The thermal entry length is (𝑥𝑡,𝑓𝑑/D)=0.05𝑅𝑒𝐷(𝑃𝑟) = 26.8(0.693) = 18.6 The L/D for this tube is (1.0/0.005) which is 200. A reasonable approach is to consider the flow, both velocity and temperature, to be fully developed over its entire tube length, since only about 10% is experiencing entry effects. For fully developed flow, constant 𝑞′′, the Nusselt number is 4.36, so 5 𝑁𝑢𝐷 = ℎ𝐷 𝑘 = 4.364 ℎ = 4.364 𝑘 𝐷 = 4.364 (0.03184 𝑊 𝑚.𝐾) 0.005 𝑚 = 27.79 W/𝑚2. 𝐾 = ℎ𝐿 = ℎ = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑛𝑡 Use an overall energy balance 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = 𝑞′′(𝐴𝑠) = 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝(𝑇𝑏,𝑜 − 𝑇𝑏,𝑖) where 𝐴𝑠 = 𝜋𝐷𝐿 = 𝜋(0.005𝑚)(1 𝑚)=1.57 × 10−2𝑚2 5- Consider the flow of oil at 200C in a 30-cm- diameter pipeline at an average velocity of 2 m/s (see the figure below). A 200-m-long section of the horizontal pipeline passes through icy waters of a lake at 00C. Measurements indicate that the surface temperature of the pipe is very nearly 00C. Disregarding the thermal resistance of the pipe material, determine (a) the temperature of the oil when the pipe leaves the lake (b) the rate of heat transfer from the oil, (c) the pumping power required to overcome the pressure losses and to maintain the flow of the oil in the pipe. Oil flows in a pipeline that passes through icy waters of a lake at 0℃. The exit temperature of the oil, the rate of heat loss, and the pumping power needed to overcome pressure losses are to be determined. Assumptions: 1- Steady operating conditions exits 2- The surface temperature of the pipe is very nearly 0℃ 3- The thermal resistance of the pipe is negligible. 4- The inner surfaces of the pipeline are smooth 5- The flow is hydrodynamically developed when the pipeline reaches the lake. Properties: we do not know the exit temperature of the oil, and thus we cannot determine the bulk mean temperature, which is the temperature at which the properties of oil are to be evaluated. The mean temperature of the oil at the inlet is 20℃, and we expect this temperature to drop somewhat as a result of heat loss to the icy waters of the lake. We evalaute the properties of the oil at the inlet temeparture, but we will repeat the calculations, if necessary, using properties at the evaluated bulk mean temperature. At 20℃ we read 𝜌 = 888.1 𝑘𝑔/𝑚3 𝑣 = 9.429 × 10−4 𝑚2/s k= 0.145 W/m.℃ 𝑐𝑝=1880 J/ kg.℃ Pr=10,863 6 Analysis: (a) The Reynolds number is 𝑅𝑒 = 𝑉𝑎𝑣𝑔𝐷 𝑣 = (2 𝑚/𝑠)(0.3𝑚) 9.429 × 10−4𝑚2/𝑠 = 636 Which is less than the critical Reynolds number and hence the flow is laminar. The thermal, entry length in this case is roughly 𝑥𝑡,𝑓𝑑 ≈ 0.05𝑅𝑒𝑃𝑟𝐷 = 0.05 × 636 × 10863 × (0.3𝑚) ≈ 103600𝑚 which is much greater than the total length of the pipe. This is typical of fluids with high Prandtl numbers. Therefore, we assume thermally developing flow and determine the Nusselt number from 𝑁𝑢=ℎ𝐷 𝑘 = 3.66 + 0.065(𝐷 𝐿)𝑅𝑒𝑃𝑟 1+0.04[(𝐷 𝐿)𝑅𝑒𝑃𝑟] 2 3 = 3.66 + 0.065( 0.3 200) × 636 × 10,863 1 + 0.04[(0.3/200) × 636 × 10863]2/3 = 33.7 Note that this Nusselt number is considerably higher than the fully developed value of 3.66. Then ℎ = 𝑘 𝐷 𝑁𝑢 = 0.145 𝑊 𝑚℃ 0.3 𝑚 (33.7) = 16.3 𝑊/𝑚2℃ Also, 𝑇𝑒 = 𝑇𝑠 − (𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑖)exp (−ℎ𝐴𝑠/𝑚̇ 𝐶𝑝) = 0℃ − [(0 − 20)℃] exp [− (163 𝑊 𝑚2℃ ) (188.5 𝑚2) (125.6 𝑘𝑔 𝑠 ) (1881 𝐽 𝑘𝑔 ℃) ] = 19.74℃ Thus, the mean temperature of oil drops by a mere 0.26℃ as it crosses the lake. This makes the bulk mean oil temperature 19.87℃, which is practically identical to the inlet temperature of 20℃. Therefore, we do not need to re-evaluate the properties. (b) The logarithmic mean temperature difference and the rate of heat loss from the oil are ∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 = 𝑇𝑖 − 𝑇𝑒 𝑙𝑛 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑒 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑖 = 20 − 19.74 𝑙𝑛 0 − 19.74 0 − 20 = −19.87℃ 𝑄̇ = ℎ𝐴𝑠∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 = (16.3 𝑊 𝑚2 ℃) (188.5𝑚2)(−19.87°𝐶) = −6.11 × 104𝑊 Therefore, the oil will lose heat at a rate of 61.1 kW as it flows through the pipe in the icy waters of the lake. Note that ∆𝑇𝑙𝑛 is identical to the arithmetic mean temeparture in this case, since ∆𝑇𝑖 ≈ ∆𝑇𝑒. (C) The laminar flow of oil is hydrodynamically developed. Therefore, the friction factor can be determined from 𝑓 = 64 𝑅𝑒 = 64 636 = 0.1006 Then the pressure drop in the pipe and the required pumping power become 7 ∆𝑃 = 𝑓 𝐿 𝐷 𝜌𝑉2 2 = 0.1006 200 𝑚 0.3 𝑚 (888.1 𝑘𝑔/𝑚3)(2 𝑚/𝑠) 2 2 = 1.19 × 105𝑁/𝑚2 𝑊̇𝑝𝑢𝑚𝑝 = (125.6 𝑘𝑔 𝑠 )(1.19 × 105𝑁/𝑚2) 888.1 𝑘𝑔/𝑚3 = 16.8 𝑘𝑊 Discussion We need a 16.8 kW pipe just to overcome the friction in the pipe as the oil flows in 200 m long pipe through the lake. 6- Air at 2 atm and 200℃ is heated as it flows through a tube with a diameter of 25.4 mm at a velocity of 10 m/s. Calculate the heat transfer per unit length of tube if a constant-heat- flux condition is maintained at the wall and the wall temperature is 20℃ above the air temeparture, all along the length of the tube. How much the bulk temperature increase over a 3-m length of the tube? Solution We first evaluate the Reynolds number at the inlet bulk temperature to determine the flow regime. The properties of air at 200℃ are 𝜌 = 𝑃 𝑅𝑇 = (2)(1.0132 × 105) (287)(473) = 1.493 𝑘𝑔/𝑚3 𝑐𝑝 = 1.025 𝑘𝐽/𝑘𝑔℃ 𝜇 = 2.57 × 10−5 𝑘𝑔 𝑚.𝑠 𝑃𝑟 = 0.681 𝑘 = 0.0386 𝑊/𝑚℃ 𝑅𝑒𝑑 = 𝜌𝑢𝑚𝑑 𝜇 = (1.493)(10)(0.0254) 2.57 × 10−5 = 14,756 so that the flow is turbulent.
