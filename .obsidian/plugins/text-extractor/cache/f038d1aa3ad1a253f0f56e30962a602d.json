The final step is to find the appropriate convection coefficients. • A detailed thermal analysis of the fully developed, laminar flow in a circular tube reveals that under these conditions Nusselt number is a constant.  For constant wall heat flux: 𝑁𝑢𝐷= ℎ𝐷 𝑘𝑓 =4.36  For constant surface temperature: 𝑁𝑢𝐷 = ℎ𝐷 𝑘𝑓 =3.66 in which D is the pipe diameter and 𝑘𝑓 is the thermal conductivity of the fluid. • Note that the constancy of Nusselt number is limited to the fully developed region and in the entrance region of the tube the Nusselt number does vary axially, why? 2 Convective heat transfer in the entrance region • Within the entrance region the boundary layers (thermal and hydrodynamic) are growing axially and therefore the heat transfer coefficient varies with x. • Why does the heat transfer rate decrease as x increases? • The heat transfer coefficient in the entrance region is usually expressed in terms of Graetz number: • It has been shown that for constant surface temperature, the average Nusselt number from the entrance to point L within the entrance region, can be estimated by: 𝑁𝑢𝐷 = 3.66 + 0.065 𝐷 𝐿 𝑅𝑒𝑃𝑟 1+0.04[ 𝐷 𝐿 𝑅𝑒𝑃𝑟]2/3 3 Convective correlations: turbulent flow in circular tubes • Turbulent flows feature a great deal of mixing, this leads to significant increase in the rate of heat transfer. As a general rule, compared to laminar flows, turbulent flows are much more capable of convecting heat. • Analysis of turbulent flows is extremely complicated and often requires massive computations using supercomputers. • We, therefore, mostly rely on experimental correlations for calculation of convective heat transfer coefficient. • For a fully developed turbulent flow in a circular tube: 𝑁𝑢𝐷 = 0.027𝑅𝑒𝐷 4 5 𝑃𝑟 1 3( 𝜇 𝜇𝑠)0.14 0.7 ≤ 𝑃𝑟 ≤ 16,700 𝑅𝑒𝐷 ≥ 10000 𝐿 𝐷 ≥ 10 To use this correlation, all the conditions have to be satisfied. 4 • In this correlation all properties, with the exception of 𝜇𝑠, are evaluated at 𝑇𝑚 (average temperature of the fluid inside the tube, i.e. (𝑇𝑚,𝑖+𝑇𝑚,𝑜)/2). • When the temperature difference is not large the following correlation can be also used: 𝑁𝑢𝐷 = 0.023𝑅𝑒𝐷 4/5𝑃𝑟𝑛 where 𝑛 = 0.4 for heating and 0.3 for cooling. • Note that this equation has been experimentally validated within the following range of parameters: 0.7 ≤ 𝑃𝑟 ≤ 160, 𝑅𝑒𝐷 ≥ 10,000, 𝐿 𝐷 ≥ 10. • These correlations (above and the one on the last slide) may be applied to both uniform surface temperature and heat flux conditions. • They give an estimation of the convective heat transfer coefficient and can include errors up to 25%! Yet, they are still widely used in engineering calculations. • To reduce the error margin to less than 10% more complex correlations should be used ( see the textbook for examples of these). 5 Example 1 678 Note that n=0.3 for this cooling problem. Non-circular cross sections • Many engineering applications involve convection transport in non-circular tubes. • In such configurations an effective diameter is defined which is often regarded as hydraulic diameter and is defined as 𝐷ℎ ≡ 4𝐴𝑐 𝑃 where 𝑨𝒄 and 𝑷 are the flow cross-sectional area and the wetted perimeter, respectively. • For turbulent flows in non-circular ducts, D in the previous correlations should be replaced by 𝐷ℎ. No other modification is necessary. • Note that the output of the calculation is the average Nusselt number over the cross section of the tube. • The previous laminar flow relations, however, cannot be used in a non-circular tube. The values of Nusselt number should be extracted from the table. Nu for fully developed laminar flow in tubes of differing cross section 9 Heat transfer enhancement • It follows from the Newton’s law of cooling (𝑄𝑠 = ℎ𝐴𝑠(∆𝑇)) that to enhance the rate of heat transfer either of the convective heat transfer coefficient or heat transfer surface area should increase. (Note that ∆𝑇 is usually specified by the application and cannot be changed). • Enhanced heat transfer leads to more efficient and usually smaller equipment and is often economically attractive. • A few methods of heat transfer enhancement are:  Introducing more turbulent flow and therefore increasing the convective heat transfer coefficient, such as increasing the surface roughness to enhance turbulence, by machining the surface or through insertion of coil-spring wire. 10 • Increasing the heat transfer surface area, which can be done by internal fins • Introducing a swirl through insertion of a twisted tape. The insert consists of a thin strip that is periodically twisted through 360 degrees. Introduction of a tangential velocity component increases the fluid velocity, particularly near the tube internal wall. • What problem these techniques may cause? 11","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
