Casting For metals, the choice of alloy is strongly linked to the shaping process. This in turn affects the microstructure and properties of the shaped part, and the possibilities for secondary processes, such as heat treatment. Two major classes of shaping process will be considered in lectures 12-14: casting (shaping by solidification in a mould) and deformation processing (shaping ductile metals using plasticity). Reasons for opting for a casting route: • Metal alloying (combining two or more elements): it is only practical to fix the composition in the liquid state (high solubility, rapid diffusion). Hence bulk metal for subsequent deformation processing is first cast in bulk (ingot, slab or billet). molten steel progressively cooled solid billets Image: Corus media gallery Example: Continuous casting of steel (Fe-C alloys). • Complex shapes can be cast directly to ‘near-net shape’, at low cost, using the high fluidity of liquid metal to fill an intricate mould. Example: Sand casting an aluminium alloy aircraft door. large, complex shape Airbus A340 passenger door (Al-Si alloy) Image courtesy of K-H Rendigs, Airbus • Some specialist materials depend on carefully controlled solidification (e.g. single crystals: silicon for semiconductors, Ni alloys for jet engines). 3 (b) grains grow until they impinge on one another (a) solid crystal nuclei orientation of nucleus orientation of final grain 5.1 Grain structure in a casting Solidification of metals in a casting process occurs by nucleation and growth of the solid phase in the liquid, as detailed in earlier lectures. Nearly all solidification of metals results in a polycrystal: grains originate from randomly oriented crystal nuclei. The grain size and shape in a casting depends on the principles of the solidification phase transformation introduced earlier in the course: (a) The rate of solidification depends on the undercooling, Δ𝑇 = 𝑇𝑚 − 𝑇: peak solidification rate limited by small ∆GRate of solidification T Tm0 K limited by low thermal energy homogeneous heterogeneous 102 atoms, r = 18 nm 102 atoms, r = 1 nm Temperature, T TmCritical radius, r* (b) Heterogeneous nucleation requires a lower undercooling than homogeneous: 4 A typical casting grain structure is shown below. Liquid metal is poured into a mould at a temperature 𝑇 > 𝑇𝑚, and cools by heat loss through the mould walls. It can be divided into three zones: mould wall (a) chill zone (b) columnar zone (c) equiaxed zonedirections of heat flow (a) Chill zone: • Near to the mould wall the liquid cools rapidly. • Nucleation starts here: larger undercooling, plus sites for heterogeneous nucleation. • Grain sizes are small, due to the high nucleation rate. chill crystals liquid mould cool warm (b) Columnar zone: • Next, as the temperature of the liquid falls, some preferentially orientated grains within the chill zone will begin to grow towards the centre of the casting: ‘columnar grains’. • At this stage, the undercooling in the liquid away from the wall is insufficient for new nuclei to form there. mould growth direction The reasons for this microstructure are as follows: (b) Equiaxed zone: • After the liquid has cooled further, nucleation may then occur in the remaining liquid, either homogenously, or (more likely) heterogeneously on dirt particles or other contamination within the melt. • These grains will have random orientations (no preferred orientation = equiaxed) and will grow until they are impinged upon by other grains. • Fewer nuclei form compared to the chill zone, due to the lower undercooling, and so the grain size is relatively large. nuclei liquid mould cool warm mould 5 Controlling grain size: achieving fine-grained castings A more uniform, fine-grained microstructure can be desirable for castings. • When casting with metal alloys, a smaller grain size helps to achieve a more uniform distribution of alloying elements and impurities: more details on this later. 𝜎𝑦 = 𝐴 + 𝐵 𝑑 Fine-grained castings can be achieved by increasing the number of nuclei that form throughout the casting. A practical strategy for achieving this is to use inoculants: • a dispersion of fine solid particles, added to the melt just before pouring into the mould • these inoculant particles provide sites for heterogeneous nucleation throughout the melt (e.g. TiB2 routinely added to Al casting alloys). dispersion of small particles many nuclei form heterogeneously • Grain boundary hardening (see part IA) is an important strengthening mechanism, particularly for pure metal castings. The yield strength increases as the grain size (𝑑) reduces: grain boundaries act as obstacles to dislocations 6 Mechanical properties of Al-Si casting alloys: • Two-phase eutectic microstructure: higher strength than pure Al, but needles of brittle Si are detrimental to toughness. • Commercial casting alloys often have their properties improved by (i) heat treatment and (ii) further alloying. • This can alter the shape and size of the brittle phases, and therefore reduce the negative impact on toughness (an example is given later for Fe-C alloys). • But alloy choice for castability also has consequences for the microstructure of the casting, and can have a negative impact on mechanical properties. Example 1: Al-Si alloys, a common casting alloy composition, wt % Sitemperature, Tpure Al adding Si reduces the melting temperature liquid Al rich solid, (Al) eutectic freezing range: affects fluidity 11.3 wt % Si Casting alloys are often near- eutectic in composition: • Low melting temperature: reduces energy costs. • Low ‘freezing range’ (gap between the liquidus and solidus temperatures): solid crystals in the melt increase its viscosity, and make it difficult to fill an intricate mould effectively. © DoITPoMS Micrograph Library, University of Cambridge (Prof T W Clyne) primary (Al) grains eutectic (Al) + Si two phases: (Al) + Si 5.2 Casting alloys In practice, castings are likely to involve alloys rather than pure metals. • The alloy choice may be driven by processability considerations: how easy and reliable it is to cast with, minimising defects. • This is particularly important for ‘near net shape’ castings (the mould defines the final shape of the component) with complex geometries: 7 Example 2: cast iron (Fe-C alloy) liquid α + Fe3C cast iron γ + Fe3C As for Al-Si alloys, cast irons are near-eutectic: easier to cast. The microstructure is multi-phase: • Ferrite and/or pearlite (ferrite + cementite phases), and graphite (pure C). • Note that this is a metastable combination of phases (i.e. it doesn’t follow the equilibrium phase diagram) – it is easier to form than the true equilibrium state. • Gives strength and wear resistance, but poor toughness: the graphite is brittle, and it forms flakes that act like cracks graphite flakes pearlite matrix Improving the properties: • A small alloying addition (of Mg) improves the toughness, by causing the graphite to form as spheres instead of flakes – a trick known as ‘poisoning’. • Graphite nodules act less like sharp cracks: smaller length scale, rounded. graphite ‘nodule’ ‘grey’ cast iron ‘spheroidal’ cast iron 8 Cooling though this two-phase region: • The first solid to form is purer (i.e. has a lower concentration) than the alloy composition. • If the alloy follows equilibrium, as the temperature falls the proportion of solid increases, and the equilibrium composition of the solid changes, increasing in concentration. • When solidification is complete, the equilibrium composition of the solid matches that of the alloy. However, in practice, real alloy solidification differs from this equilibrium scenario: • Equilibrium solidification requires solute to diffuse into the solid, increasing its concentration as the temperature falls (following the solidus composition). • In practice, diffusion is too slow for this to happen, and a gradient in concentration is “locked in”, across each grain. This is known as segregation. Segregation leads to concentration gradients across two length scales, with higher solute concentrations in the last solid to form: (i) across a grain, from the centre to the boundary: microsegregation (ii) across a whole casting, from the mould to the centre: macrosegregation A similar process also leads to a non-uniform distribution of impurities: • Metals always contain impurities: e.g. S and O in steels, left over from the original extraction processes. • These often dissolve readily in the liquid, but not in the solid. • During solidification, the impurities are therefore rejected into the liquid, concentrating in the last liquid to solidify: i.e. at grain boundaries (microsegregation), and the centre of the casting (macrosegregation). 5.3 Segregation: concentration gradients in cast alloys One consequence of casting with alloys (rather than pure metals) is that a non-uniform distribution of alloying elements (and impurities) can develop on solidification. From the phase diagram, changing the alloy composition affects both 𝑇𝑚 and the temp- erature range over which solidification occurs: “partition” of the liquidus and solidus. 9 Consequences of segregation: (a) Non-uniform distribution of main alloying elements: • Leads to a variation in yield strength (by solid solution or precipitation hardening). (b) Concentration of impurities on grain boundaries: • The impurities may form solid phases (a problem if these are brittle) or trapped bubbles of gas (giving porosity). • This is damaging to properties – notably toughness. Solutions to segregation: (1) Reduce the grain size of the casting (e.g. using inoculants – see above). A smaller grain size means a large grain boundary area over which to distribute the impurities / porosity that accumulate there, and so lower local impurity concentrations. (2) Add small alloying additions that react with impurities. This forms a fine dispersion of solid particles during solidification, trapping the impurity in a harmless state. Examples: Mn and Al in carbon steels, trapping impurity S and O, as MnS and Al2O3. (3) ‘Homogenise’ the casting: heating up the casting, to enable redistribution of the solute by diffusion. Modelling homogenisation: We can use diffusion analysis to give a first order model of the redistribution of solute atoms by diffusing during homogenisation. To achieve this, we need to make some modelling simplifications. These are not completely realistic, but it gives a first order estimate of the key parameter dependencies. We will assume: 1. Diffusion occurs in 1D, along an 𝑥-direction traversing the grain. 2. All grains have the same size, 𝑑. 3. The initial solute concentration is a sinusoidal function of 𝑥, with average 𝐶0 and peak 𝐶1 at the grain boundaries. x-direction Taking 𝑥 = 0 at a grain boundary, we have initial conditions: 𝐶 𝑥, 0 = 𝐶0 + (𝐶1−𝐶0) cos 2𝜋𝑥 𝑑 𝐶 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝐶0 + (𝐶1−𝐶0) cos 2𝜋𝑥 𝑑 exp − 4𝜋2𝐷𝑡 𝑑2 Following the method outlined previously, this leads to the solution: 10 Although approximate, this solution indicates some important parameter sensitivities for the homogenisation process. • Homogenisation will be considered complete once the amplitude of concentration fluctuations drops below a specified level. The time constant governing the rate of decay of the amplitude: 𝜏 = 𝑑2 4𝜋2𝐷 • There is therefore strong temperature dependence on the rate of homogenisation, via the diffusion coefficient: 𝐷 = 𝐷0 exp − 𝑄 𝑅𝑇 • There is also sensitivity to the grain size, due to the 𝑑2 dependency. Inoculants (see above) can be used to achieve a fine-grained casting, and reduce the homogenisation time. Now attempt: Examples Paper 4, Q.7-8 5.4 Summary of the learning outcomes: casting After completing section 5 you will be able to do the following: 1.

Analyse the homogenisation of a casting using diffusion theory. 5.5 Quiz W6.2: casting The microstructure of a casting often consists of a fine-grained structure near to the mould wall. Which of the following correctly explain this observation (more than one can be correct)? 1. The undercooling is larger near the mould wall. 2. There are sites for heterogeneous nucleation at the mould wall. 3. The casting alloy is near the eutectic composition. 4. Segregation occurs during solidification.

Deformation processing: microstructure control Metals and alloys that have been shaped by deformation processes are known as ‘wrought’. They must be sufficiently ductile to undergo large amounts of plastic straining without failing. Deformation processes are mostly done in compression, to avoid necking and tensile failure at large strains. This section focuses on the microstructural changes that occur during deformation processing of metals, and how properties and microstructure can be controlled. 12 (1) Grains change shape, following the overall imposed strain, because plastic deformation in metals occurs at constant volume. This is due to the microstructural origins of metal plasticity: deformation occurs by dislocations gliding through the material in shear (refer to your IA notes for a reminder on this). “equiaxed” grains “pancaked” grains (2) Work hardening occurs, increasing the yield stress. Recall from IA that this is related to an increase in dislocation density ( 𝜌𝑑 ) during plastic straining, and the interactions between these dislocations. • As 𝜌𝑑 increases, the spacing between dislocations ( 𝑠 ) reduces: unit length Per unit length of dislocation: 𝑠 𝑠 𝜌𝑑 = 1 𝑠2 ⇒ 𝑠 = 1 𝜌𝑑 • Dislocations pin each other: the shear stress required to overcome obstacles is inversely proportional to the obstacle spacing ( = 𝑠 ). • So, the yield strength increases as 𝜌𝑑 increases: 𝜎𝑦 ∝ 1 𝑠 = 𝜌𝑑 6.1 Cold working Deformation processes taking place at room temperature are referred to as “cold working”. The following microstructural changes occur: 13 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 200 400 600 800stress (MPa) strain All curves: σ = 100 MPa at ε = 0.002 A useful and realistic model for the work hardening stress-strain curve for metals is given by the power law relationship: 𝜎 = 𝑎 𝘀𝑛 𝑎, 𝑛 = constants 𝑛 = 0.1 – 0.3 (typically) 𝑛 = 0.1 𝑛 = 0.2 𝑛 = 0.3 Work hardening is useful in the final deformation steps, to increase the yield strength. However, earlier in the deformation processing, it brings problems: • As deformation progresses: applied forces must increase • Ductility reduces: risk of fracture Deforming to large plastic strains therefore becomes difficult (e.g. rolling aluminium foil). To make large strain processes possible, we need to anneal the material periodically.temperature, T~0.5 Tm time, t The driving force for the microstructural changes that take place during annealing is the elastic stored energy within the material that results from the increased dislocation density during cold working. During plastic deformation, the work done is given by the area under the stress-strain curve: plastic work: not recoveredstress strain elastic energy recovered when material breaks 6.2 Annealing Annealing is a form of heat treatment. The material is heated in order to reverse the effects of work hardening: • reduce the yield strength • increase the ductility. 14 Considering the plastic work done (the energy not recovered on fracture): • ~ 95% is dissipated as heat • ~ 5% remains stored in the material in dislocations Recall from IA that dislocations induce elastic strain in the lattice around them, which can be expressed as a line energy per unit length. This is the source of the stored energy as the dislocation density (length/unit volume) increases. During annealing, two microstructural changes occur, which reduce this stored energy associated with dislocations. Both depend, to some extent, on diffusion of atoms, and are therefore temperature dependent. Mechanism 1: Recovery One route is for dislocations to rearrange into a pattern that reduces the strain in the crystal lattice around them: this is called recovery. aligned dislocations form ‘sub-grain’ boundaries aligned dislocations have a lower energy compared to a random arrangement original grain boundary “sub-grains” (1) dislocations of opposite orientation can annihilate each other: (2) dislocations of similar orientations can align and form subgrains: • These processes depend on (i) glide of dislocations and (ii) local rearrangements of the crystal structure near to the dislocations by diffusion of atoms. • Minimum annealing temperature for recovery to occur: 𝑇min ≈ 0.1 𝑇𝑚 • Only a small drop in dislocation density occurs: small drop in 𝜎𝑦 15 Mechanism 2: Recrystallisation Another route to relieve stored dislocation strain energy is to nucleate and grow new crystals within the work hardened grains: • New grains: much lower 𝜌𝑑 ⇒ large drop in 𝜎𝑦 deformed, work hardened grains nucleation and growth of new grains recrystallisation complete 𝜌𝑑 ≈ 10 15 m −2 𝜌𝑑 ≈ 10 11 m −2 • Recrystallisation requires more significant atomic rearrangement by diffusion than recovery, so higher temperatures are required. • Minimum annealing temperature for recrystallisation to occur: 𝑇min ≈ 0.3 𝑇𝑚 When to anneal? Example: cold rolling annealing schedule. In cold rolling, the thickness of the sheet is progressively reduced by many passes through a rolling mill. The decision on when to perform intermediate annealing steps is based on two factors: • The yield stress remaining below a critical value during rolling set by the load limits on the rolling mill. • Meeting a final yield stress requirement, to ensure the rolled material is within its design strength range. pass number anneal yield stress thickness To work out the annealing schedule, start by calculating the total number of passes required to achieve the required thickness reduction. Next, calculate the strain per pass. If a pass through the rollers reduces the thickness from 𝑡0 to 𝑡1, the true strain is: 𝘀𝑡 = ln 1 + 𝘀𝑛 = ln 1 + 𝑡1 − 𝑡0 𝑡0 = ln 𝑡1 𝑡0 16 Note the sign convention here is tensile strains are positive. True strain is convenient to use as, unlike nominal strain, it is additive. For 𝑁 passes, the total true strain is equal to the sum of the true strains in each pass: 𝘀𝑡 = ln 𝑡1 𝑡0 + ln 𝑡2 𝑡1 + … ln 𝑡𝑁 𝑡𝑁−1 = ln 𝑡1 𝑡0 𝑡2 𝑡1 … 𝑡𝑁 𝑡𝑁−1 = ln 𝑡𝑁 𝑡0 Whereas the total nominal strain is not: 𝘀𝑛 = 𝑡𝑁 − 𝑡0 𝑡0 ≠ 𝑡1 − 𝑡0 𝑡0 + 𝑡2 − 𝑡1 𝑡1 + … As the magnitude of the strain increases, so does the yield stress, due to work hardening : • A power law relationship can be used to model this, as outlined above: 𝜎 = 𝑎 𝘀𝑛 • The magnitude of the strain can be used in the hardening law – the sign convention adopted above can be dropped. • Each anneal has the effect of “resetting” the strain to zero (though the thickness reduction will be preserved). The annealing schedule is set by determining: (1) The thickness reduction (number of passes) between the final anneal and the final product, to meet the design spec on product strength. (2) The maximum thickness reduction between anneals, set by the rolling mill force limit. This determines how many additional annealing steps are required. Example of a cold rolling annealing schedule (Examples Paper 5 Q2) • Cold rolling: 𝑡0 = 0.4 mm → 𝑡𝑓 = 6.7 𝜇m • Thickness reduction per pass: 40 % → 8 passes required (regardless of annealing) • Strain: 𝘀 = ln(𝑡𝑁/𝑡0) • Yield stress (MPa): 𝜎 = 100 𝘀 0.3 (strain accumulated since last anneal) min strength max strength 17 The dislocation strain energy depends on the dislocation density 𝜌𝑑. This in turn is related to the amount of plastic strain 𝘀. No recrystallisation occurs below a critical level of plastic strain, 𝘀𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡. The final grain size depends on 𝘀 − 𝘀𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 . new grain size prior strain, ε εcrit ( ε - εcrit ) small → large grains ε < εcrit no recrystallisation ( ε - εcrit ) large → fine grains original grain size 1 old grain size ( few nuclei ) ( many nuclei ) Example: Aluminium recrystallisation Illustrated below is an experiment carried out to identify the effect of prior straining on the recrystallised grain structure of aluminium sheet: strips are stretched to a particular strain annealed in a furnace at 550˚C for 20 minutes chemical etch reveals grain structure prior strain, ε 6.3 Using recrystallisation to control grain size Just as nucleation can be used to control grain size in a casting, similar principles apply to recrystallisation. In casting, the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation is the Gibbs free energy change, Δ𝐺. In recrystallisation, the driving force for nucleation of new grains is the dislocation strain energy. 18 Grain growth after recrystallisation If the material is held at a high temperature after recrystallisation has completed, grain growth will occur. • Grain boundaries, as discontinuities in the crystal structure, carry an energy penalty (similar to the interface energy when a solid nucleus forms in a liquid). • If atoms are able to continue to rearrange by diffusion, the grain size will tend to increase, thus reducing the surface area to volume ratio of the grains. A larger grain size (𝑑) reduces the grain boundary hardening: 𝜎𝑦 = 𝐴 + 𝐵 𝑑 Image: Corus media gallery This has a number of advantages: • The material yield strength remains low, due to a lack of strain hardening, and the deformed material remains ductile: - lower tool forces required - larger strains in one pass • No need for separate heat treatment. 6.4 Hot working In practice, the processes of deformation and annealing are often combined by hot working the material. The material is deformed at high temperature ( ~ 0.7 𝑇𝑚 ). 6.5 Summary of the learning outcomes: deformation processing and microstructure After completing section 6 you will be able to do the following: 1. Compare the attributes of wrought alloys and casting alloys. 2. Explain the role of annealing during hot or cold working of a wrought alloy. 3. Describe the annealing mechanisms of recovery and recrystallisation. 4. Explain the use of recrystallisation to control grain size. 7. Deformation processing: process modelling In this section we will analyse the forces required to shape components via deformation processes. We will consider two examples: forging and rolling. These process models help to show the key parameter sensitivities within the manufacturing process. For example, the relationship between forces and: • material properties (such as 𝜎𝑦), • processing conditions (such as friction), • component shape (thickness, aspect ratio). The models rely on the following key principles: • equilibrium of stresses, • material laws: yield criteria for metals, • fiction laws: boundary conditions between the tool and workpiece. 19 6.6 Quiz W7.1: deformation processing and microstructure ‘Wrought’ alloys are suitable for shaping by deformation processes. A wrought mild steel (0.15 wt% C) is compared with cast iron (3.1 wt% C). Which of the following statements are correct (more than one can be correct)? 1. Cast iron contains more carbon than mild steel in order to increase its toughness. 2. Mild steel is less suited to near net shape casting because it is further from the eutectic composition. 3. Mild steel is more suited to deformation processing because it is more ductile. 4. The strength of mild steel can be increased by annealing. Now attempt: Examples Paper 5, Q.1-2 20 Yield criteria are expressed in terms of the principal stresses: (𝜎1, 𝜎2 , 𝜎3 ) • For any element of material, an orientation of the faces exists where the shear stresses vanish. • These are the principal stress directions, and the direct stresses at these orientations are the principal stresses. • They can be determined by rotating around Mohr’s circle. Note also that the maximum shear stress acting on an element in a particular plane is given by the radius of Mohr’s circle: i.e. 𝜏max = 1 2 𝜎1 − 𝜎2 (in the 1-2 plane) Two yield criteria have been introduced: • Tresca yield criterion: max{ 𝜎1 − 𝜎2 , 𝜎2 − 𝜎3 , 𝜎3 − 𝜎1 } = 𝑌 physical basis: critical maximum shear stress • von Mises yield criterion: physical basis: critical elastic shear strain energy 𝜎1 − 𝜎2 2 + 𝜎2 − 𝜎3 2 + 𝜎3 − 𝜎1 2 = 2𝑌2 Here, 𝑌 = uniaxial yield stress (also commonly given the symbol 𝜎𝑦 ). In both cases, a key feature of the model is that shear governs yielding: • A purely hydrostatic state of stress has 𝜎1 = 𝜎2 = 𝜎3. It induces no shear on any material plane (the Mohr’s circle is just a point on the σ axis), and does not cause yielding, according to either yield criterion. • This is supported by experimental observation: metal yielding is insensitive to hydrostatic stress (though other materials are - e.g. foams). • This is due to the microstructural basis of plasticity: metal plasticity occurs by dislocation movement, driven by shear stresses. • Note that this mechanism of plastic deformation does not require a volume change (confirmed experimentally). 𝜏 7.1 Modelling yielding in metals For multiaxial stress states, the combination of stresses at the onset of yielding can be modelled using yield criteria, introduced in more detail in the IB Structures course. 21 Forging parts with complex shapes will often be carried out incrementally, over a number of forging stages. For example, for a con-rod: flash many forging stages con-rod Friction plays an important role in the forging loads. Its contribution is sensitive to the degree of contact between the workpiece and the dies: Average pressure  1 – 2 Y  5 – 10 Y  3 – 5 Y 7.2 Analysis of forging Forging involves compressive plastic deformation of a solid between two dies. Over 90% of forging is done hot: • lower yield stress ⇒ lower forces required, greater complexity of shape possible 22 We will analyse the open-die forging of a slab between parallel dies. • Dimensions: slab height = 2ℎ , width = 2ℎ, depth (into page) = 𝑑 (>> ℎ) • The dies are lubricated to minimise the forging load and reduce die wear, but some friction between the slab and dies is unavoidable. • The direction of the friction shear stress will oppose the flow of material away from the centre line. 𝑑 Force 𝐹 2𝑤 2ℎ 𝛿𝑥 𝑥 “Plane strain”: zero strain in thickness direction Friction stress 𝜏 𝘀𝑧 = 0 slab die die Aim of the analysis: (i) Calculate the pressure 𝑝(𝑥) between the slab and dies. (ii) Integrate 𝑝(𝑥) to give the forging force 𝐹. Step 1 – Consider equilibrium of a small element of material Consider an element of material at a distance 𝑥 (𝑥 > 0) from the centre line of the forging, with width 𝛿𝑥 and height 2ℎ. Note that the pressure 𝑝, friction stress 𝜏 and horizontal stress in the material 𝜎𝑥 will, in general, vary with position 𝑥. 𝜎𝑥(𝑥) 𝑝(𝑥) 𝜏(𝑥) 𝜎𝑥 + 𝑑𝜎𝑥 𝑑𝑥 𝛿𝑥 𝜏(𝑥) 𝑝(𝑥) 𝑥 Consider unit depth into the page. Take compressive 𝑝(𝑥) and 𝜎𝑥(𝑥) as positive Resolving forces horizontally: 2ℎ𝜎𝑥 − 2ℎ 𝜎𝑥 + 𝑑𝜎𝑥 𝑑𝑥 𝛿𝑥 − 2𝜏𝛿𝑥 = 0 ∴ 𝑑𝜎𝑥 𝑑𝑥 = − 𝜏 ℎ (1) 23 Step 2 – Apply the yield criterion This will allow us to relate 𝜎𝑥 and 𝑝 (the pressure is what we want to find). The material must be yielding everywhere, so the stresses must satisfy a yield criterion. • We need to identify the principal stress. To simplify the analysis, we will assume that the frictional shear stress 𝜏 is small compared to 𝜎𝑥 and 𝑝 . So we will take 𝜎𝑥 and 𝑝 as approximately the principal stress. 𝜎𝑥(𝑥) 𝑝(𝑥) • Note also that the magnitude of 𝑝 > 𝜎𝑥 . To first order, the pressure 𝑝 ~ 𝑌 , whereas 𝜎𝑥 ~ 𝜏. The frictional shear stresses will often be much less than the yield stress. Using the Tresca criterion (algebraically simpler): 𝑝 − 𝜎𝑥 = 𝑌 Substituting for 𝜎𝑥 into equation (1), and assuming the yield stress 𝑌 is constant (i.e. no work hardening – a reasonable approximation in hot forming) : 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑥 = − 𝜏 ℎ (2) Step 3 – Friction law We can choose from a number of models to represent the effect of friction. The best choice would have to be determined by experiment. (1) Coulomb friction: the shear stress is taken to be proportional to the pressure: 𝜏 = 𝜇𝑝 The coefficient of friction 𝜇 will depend on the materials and the lubrication. (2) Tresca friction: the shear stress is taken to be proportional to the shear yield stress, 𝑘: 𝜏 = 𝑚𝑘 Note that the shear yield stress: 𝑘 = 𝑌/2 (Materials Databook; Tresca yield criterion). The friction factor 𝑚 varies in the range 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 1 depending on the lubrication. Taking 𝑚 = 1 is known as ‘sticking friction’. Assume Tresca friction, and substitute for 𝜏 into equation (2): 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑥 = − 𝑚𝑘 ℎ = − 𝑚𝑌 2ℎ (3) 24 Step 4 – Integrate, identifying suitable boundary conditions At the edge of the strip, 𝑥 = ±𝑤: • The surface is stress free: 𝜎𝑥 = 0 • Therefore, applying the Tresca yield criterion: 𝑝 = 𝜎𝑥 + 𝑌 = 𝑌 Integrating equation (3), applying these boundary conditions: න 𝑝(𝑥) 𝑌 𝑑𝑝 = − 𝑚𝑌 2ℎ න 𝑥 𝑤 𝑑𝑥 ⇒ 𝑝 𝑥 = 𝑌 + 𝑚𝑌 2ℎ 𝑤 − 𝑥 [𝑥 > 0] If we repeat the analysis for an element of material on the left-hand side of the centre line (𝑥 < 0), the equations are identical apart from a change in the sign of 𝜏, because friction acts in the opposite direction here (material flows to the left): 𝑑𝜎𝑥 𝑑𝑥 = + 𝜏 ℎ → 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑥 = + 𝑚𝑌 2ℎ → 𝑝 𝑥 = 𝑌 + 𝑚𝑌 2ℎ 𝑤 + 𝑥 [𝑥 < 0] The solution for p 𝑥 is plotted below for different values of the friction factor 𝑚. This is known as the “friction hill”: increasing m x p(x) 2h slab 2w 𝑝max = 𝑌 1 + 𝑚𝑤 2ℎ The total forging load (per unit depth) can be found by integrating p 𝑥 over the width of the strip. This can also be expressed as an average pressure, 𝑝 : 𝐹 = න −𝑤 +𝑤 𝑝 𝑥 𝑑𝑥 = 2𝑤𝑌 1 + 𝑚𝑤 4ℎ ⇒ 𝑝 = 𝐹 2𝑤 = 𝑌 1 + 𝑚𝑤 4ℎ The model, though approximate, helps to identify the key parameters that influence the forging load: • Material parameter – yield stress, 𝑌: ↑ temperature ⇒ ↓ 𝑌 ⇒ ↓ 𝐹 • Process parameter – friction factor, 𝑚: ↑ lubrication ⇒ ↓ 𝑚 ⇒ ↓ 𝐹 • Design parameter – aspect ratio, 𝑤/ℎ : high 𝑤/ℎ ⇒ high 𝐹 25 The dependence on 𝑤/ℎ means that the ‘flash’ should be minimised – thin sections can contribute significantly to the forging load. flash This similarity in the pressure distribution between rolling and forging is due to a similarity in the frictional shear stress distribution across the width of the contact patch: • At the inlet, the roll speed (𝜔𝑅) is faster than the strip speed (𝑉𝐼𝑁). The frictional shear stress pulls the strip into the roll gap. (Some friction is therefore essential for this process, even though it increases the rolling forces). • Conservation of mass means that 𝑉𝑂𝑈𝑇 > 𝑉𝐼𝑁. At the outlet, the roll speed is less than the strip speed, so the friction now opposes the strip motion. • The position in the roll gap where the roll and strip have the same speed (𝜔𝑅) is the neutral plane. At this position, the frictional shear stress changes direction, and the pressure is a maximum (as derived in the forging analysis, above). 7.3 Analysis of rolling The detailed analysis of rolling is beyond the scope of this course. However, the pressure variation between the rollers also follows a “friction hill” behaviour, very similar to the forging problem. For Coulomb friction, 𝜏 = 𝜇𝑝: 26 The rolling force is given by the integral of the pressure distribution: 𝐹 = න 𝑝 𝑥 𝑑𝑥 A first estimate could be obtained by taking 𝑝 𝑥 from the forging analysis above, taking the strip thickness in the forging model to be the average strip thickness in the rolling process. Note that the force 𝐹 on the strip does not act through the roll axis ⇒ a torque 𝑻 must also be applied. The rolling torque: 𝑇 = 𝐹 × 𝛼𝑅 where 𝛼 ≈ 0.1 − 0.5 needs to be obtained from a more detailed calculation (beyond the scope of this course). Tensile testing was introduced in the IA Materials course. Torsion theory has been introduced in IB Structures. A torsion test loads the material in shear. tension test torsion test normal stress, σ shear stress, τ Torsion testing has some advantages over tensile testing: • Necking does not occur in torsion. The necking instability in a tensile test limits the amount of plastic straining that a test specimen can be subjected to. • A torsion test is therefore a good way to investigate strain hardening behaviour, up to large plastic strains. 7.4 Case study: wrought vs cast alloys in torsion The typical composition of a wrought alloy (shaped by deformation, and so ductile) leads to contrasting mechanical properties versus casting alloys (chosen near eutectic, for processibility). This case study describes an experimental investigation using torsion testing to comparing their properties. 27 But torsion testing has the disadvantage that the stress state in the material is more complicated than in a tension test. • Firstly, this is because a stress state of pure shear gives one tensile and one compressive principal stress, from Mohr’s circle. The principal stresses will be at ±45° to the bar axis:  max= min=–  max= min=−  T • Secondly, the magnitude of the shear stress will vary with radial position ( 𝑟 ) in the bar. Recall from the Structures course, for an elastic bar with a circular cross section: 𝜏 𝑟 = 𝑇𝑟 𝐽 𝑇 = torque, 𝐽 = 𝜋𝑅4 2 for a bar of outer radius 𝑅 Wrought alloy: mild steel with composition 0.15 wt% C. • Its microstructure is mostly soft and ductile ferrite, with a small fraction of harder pearlite (ferrite + cementite, Fe3C). 50 μm Mild Steel (0.15 wt% C) Ferrite Pearlite Casting alloy: cast iron with composition 3.1 wt% C. • The higher C concentration brings it closer to the eutectic composition (see earlier lectures). • Its microstructure in this case is mostly pearlite, with large flakes of brittle graphite. 50 μm Cast Iron (3.1 wt% C) Graphite flakes Pearlite matrix Test method Test specimens, solid bars with circular cross-sections, were manufactured from two contrasting alloys: 28 The bars were tested to failure using one of the CUED torsion testing machines. This allows a plot of torque versus angle of twist (per unit length of bar) to be produced. (1) Specimens have square ends, to allow them to be gripped by carrier plates (2) The torque is applied by hanging weights from a lever arm (3) For each value of applied torque, the hand wheel is turned to twist the specimen, until the lever arm is raised to the horizontal (4) The angle of twist can then be read off a protractor on the hand wheel. Torsion test results The torsion test results up to fracture for the two specimens are shown below: 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 100 200 300 400 Twist (rad / m)Torque (Nm) mild steel cast iron Observations: • The mild steel behaves in a ductile manner, yielding at a torque of 50 Nm. The bar, of length 150 mm, breaks after nearly 10 complete revolutions. It fractures perpendicular to the axis of the bar. • The cast iron doesn’t show any significant plastic deformation. It breaks in a brittle manner at a torque of 415 Nm. It fractures in a spiral shape. 29 Analysis: mild steel bar At the beginning of the test, the mild steel bar will deform elastically. During elastic torsion of a circular bar, the shear stress increases linearly from the centre to the surface of the bar. The maximum shear stress at 𝑟 = 𝑅 is: 𝜏max = 𝑇𝑅 𝐽 = 𝑇𝑅 𝜋𝑅4 2 = 2𝑇 𝜋𝑅3 Yielding will occur here first. The bar has a diameter of 12.6 mm. Using the measured torque at the onset of yielding (𝑇𝑦 = 50 Nm) the shear yield stress (𝒌) can be calculated: 𝜏max = 𝑘 = 2𝑇𝑦 𝜋𝑅3 = 2(50) 𝜋(6.3 × 10−3)3 = 128 MPa We need to use the yield criteria to relate 𝑘 to the uniaxial yield stress 𝑌 for the steel. From the Mohr’s circle for an element of material in pure shear, the in-plane principal stresses at yield are: 𝜎1 = 𝑘, 𝜎2 = −𝑘 In pure shear, the out-of-plane direction is stress free: 𝜎3 = 0 We can plot the two yield criteria on principal stress axes, to show the combination of (𝜎1, 𝜎2) at the onset of yielding. Tresca von Mises Substituting the principal stresses into the yield criteria: • Tresca: 𝑘 = 𝑌 2 • von Mises: 𝑘 = 𝑌 3 ≈ 0.58𝑌 The predicted uniaxial yield stresses are therefore: • Tresca: 𝑌 = 2𝑘 = 256 MPa • von Mises: 𝑌 = 3𝑘 = 222 MPa These are consistent with expected values for EN1A mild steel. 30 Sources of uncertainty? • Choice of yield criterion: For stress states other than uniaxial loading, the two yield criteria give slightly different predictions for the relationship between Y and k. • Detecting the onset of yielding: • In a tension test, the stress state is uniform, so yielding occurs simultaneously throughout the cross section. • In a torsion test, the stress state is non-uniform. It may therefore be difficult to detect precisely the first onset of yield, which occurs only at the surface. • Further increasing the torque will cause the region of plastically deforming material to propagate towards the centre of the bar, until it is fully plastic. There is therefore no clear single ‘yield point’. Mode of failure? The specimen finally fails along a plane perpendicular to the axis of the bar. • This is a plane of maximum shear stress, from Mohr’s circle. • This is a characteristic of ductile fracture. Recall that shear stresses are key for plastic deformation of ductile metals. Analysis: cast iron bar The cast iron bar was observed to fail in a brittle manner. Yield criteria therefore won’t be applicable. But we can use the mode of failure to deduce a more appropriate criterion. • spiral fracture, 45° to bar axis ⇒ failure governed by the maximum tensile stress (from Mohr’s circle - see above) 𝜎max = 𝜏max = 2𝑇 𝜋𝑅3 Assuming the bar remains elastic up to failure, from Mohr’s circle (see above) the maximum tensile stress: Using the measured torque at fracture 𝑇𝑓 = 415 Nm, and the cast iron bar diameter 2𝑅 = 17.7 mm, the tensile stress at fracture: 𝜎𝑓 = 2𝑇𝑓 𝜋𝑅3 = 2(415) 𝜋(8.85 × 10−3)3 = 381 MPa 31 Using linear elastic fracture mechanics (refer to your IA Materials notes, and see also Examples Paper 4 Q7), we can use the fracture stress 𝜎𝑓 to estimate the fracture toughness of the material. • At fracture, the stress intensity: 𝐾 ≈ 𝜎𝑓 𝜋𝑎 = 𝐾𝐼𝐶 50 μm Cast Iron (3.1 wt% C) Graphite flakes Pearlite matrix The Data Book gives 𝐾𝐼𝐶 = 20 - 40 MPa m for cast iron, indicating that casting defects with size of the order of mm may initiate failure for these torsion specimens. • Assuming the critical flaw is a graphite flake: flaw size 𝑎 ≈ 100 µm ⇒ 𝐾𝐼𝐶 ≈ 7 MPa m • Assuming the critical flat is a casting defect (e.g. air bubble) flaw size 𝑎 ≈ 1 mm ⇒ 𝐾𝐼𝐶 ≈ 21 MPa m 7.5 Summary of the learning outcomes: deformation process modelling After completing section 7 you will be able to do the following: 1.
