Miller 2 Lecture 6: Power generation I 3 We mentioned repeatedly that the Carnot cycle is the most efficient cycle operating between two specified temperature limits. Thus it is natural to look at the Carnot cycle first as a prospective ideal cycle for vapour power plants. If we could, we would certainly adopt it as the ideal cycle. However, in practice there are several impracticalities: 1. In the heat addition (2-3) the temperature is limited to the critical point value, which is 374°C for water. This limits the maximum temperature of the heat addition and thus the Carnot efficiency. 2. The expansion process (3-4) is in the two-phase region. The impingement of liquid droplets onto the turbine blades causes erosion. 3. The compression process (1-2) is also in the two-phase region. It is not possible to design a pump which handles two-phase flow. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Lecture 7: Power generation II 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 7.13 Analysis of HRSG An HRSG is a heat-exchanger which exchanges heat from the exhaust gas of the gas turbine to the boiler of the Rankine cycle. The HRSG is a counter flow heat-exchanger. This means that the gas (hot side), supplied by the gas turbine exhaust, enters at one end and the water (cold side), in a steam boiler, enter at opposite end. The aim of the heat-exchanger designer is usually to minimise the temperature difference between the hot and cold flow at each point through the device. This lowers the ‘finite temperature difference’ over which the heat transfer occurs and thus lower the irreversible entropy generation. A zoom in of the HRSG is shown below. The diagram used to analyse heat-exchangers is a distance temperature diagram. An example of this is shown below. The x axis is the fraction of heat transferred and the y axis is the temperature of each stream. On the cold side the water is first heated and then changes phase from liquid water to steam. The closest temperature between two streams is usually the point at which the water becomes saturated. This point is known as the ‘pinch point’. gas H2O Q 21 An analysis of a HRSG usually involves either being given the temperatures at the four end points, 2, 3, 8, 9 and being asked to calculate the ratio of mass flows between the two streams or being given the ratio of mass flows and three of the temperatures and being asked to calculate the fourth temperature. The procedure is similar for both cases. First equate the heat flow between the two sides of the heat exchanger. the enthalpy change of the exhaust gas can be determined using the specific heat at constant pressure. The enthalpy of the steam and water must be looked up in the CUED tables. If a question asks you to calculate the ‘pinch point’ temperature difference then a heat flow balance between the pinch point and one end of the heat-exchanger is necessary. In practice this involves drawing a control volume from the pinch point location around both sides of the heat-exchanger to one end of the heat-exchanger. To calculate the entropy generated in a HRSG it is necessary to sum the entropy change of the two flows. The flow with heat extraction will of course drop in entropy while the flow with heat addition will rise in entropy. The sum total of these will be either positive or zero. The lost work potential in the combined flows is given by The specific entropy of the water and steam can be obtained from tables in the CUED data book. The equation for the specific entropy change of a perfect gas can be obtained from p3 of the CUED data book.

The horizontal axis shows the thermal efficiency of a Rankine cycle and a combined cycle burning gas. The vertical axis shows the heat efficiency of two types of home boiler, a standard type and a condensing type. The lines joining each pair of points show mixes of heat and electricity from burning gas. By fixing the combination of heat and electricity you require your gas supply to provide you can sit anywhere on one of the two lines. The bottom line represents old technology and top line new technology. The two lines above (green in the lecture) represent taking electricity from the average combined cycle power plant in the UK and choosing for a fraction of it to operate a heat pump. The bottom line is a heat pump with a COP of 3 and top line a COP of 4. The analysis allows for transmission line losses of 8%. The analysis shows that if all the electricity is used to operate a heat pump, with COP of 4, the heat efficiency would be 185%. This is a surprising result as burning the fuel in a condensing boiler results in a heat efficiency of 90%, half the value. NB There is no rule that says that the maximum heat efficiency that you can get from a chemical energy source is 100%. The limit is set by the 2 nd law. If you consider a reversible case, the best the 2 nd law tells you can occur, the maximum heat efficiency is set by the temperatures across which the heat engine and the heat pump operate. Consider the case of fuel burnt at 1500k in an environment of 300k. The Carnot efficiency is 80%. If this was then used to power a heat pump operating between the environment at 300k and a reservoir at 310k the Carnot COP would be 31. This would give a theoretical heat efficiency of 2480%. In future heat pumps will probably get even better and become much more common. In Japan, thanks to strong legislation favouring efficiency, heat pumps are now available with COP of 4.9. By powering heat pumps using renewable energy we have a method of zero carbon heating and cooling. 30 Lecture 9: Properties of mixtures 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 A recent study by the US National Research Council concluded that flying in an aircraft is as likely to make you sick as any other enclosed environment, such as a cinema or office. “There is always an increased risk of infection whenever you enter a confined space, but an aircraft cabin is no worse an environment than the office you sit in every day. Modern aircraft refresh air 15 times an hour, compared to fewer than 12 times hour in an office building.” states Dr Mark Grendeau. “On most transatlantic jets the air is filtered through hospital-grade filters that are designed to remove over 99% of bacteria and particles. The cabin is also separated into ventilation systems covering typically every seven rows, limiting the spread of germs through the plane.” Travellers, however, often complain about picking up colds and viruses on flights. The research shows that this is unlikely to be true and that symptoms similar to those caused by a cold or virus are brought on by the low relative humidity. Aircraft manufacturers seem to differ in the reason they give for the low relative humidity in aircraft. Sometimes it is stated that the low relative humidity is deliberate and is used to prevent the fuselage from corroding. It seems unlikely though that the airlines would be prepared to carry the excess weight of water required to humidify the air. It will be interesting to see whether the next generation of planes with composite fuselages have a raised cabin relative humidity. 39 Lecture 10: Combustion processes 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Depending on the temperature and composition of the products the change in enthalpy can be calculated in a number of ways. If the combustion is undertaken with a large excess of air (very lean) the products after combustion may still be relatively cold. This is the case in large industrial space heaters. In such cases the cp of the combined combustion products are often found to be relatively constant. In such problems the reactant and products enthalpy changes can be calculated simply, by using cp∆T. If the combustion occurs without a large excess of air (not very lean) the final temperature of the products will be high and cp of each of the products will vary non-linearly with temperature. In these cases the molar enthalpies on p13 of the CUED data book must be used. In cases likely the above problem of a gas turbine combustor the temperature of the reactants is initially high. The reactants are made up of air and fuel. The fuel is normally supplied at 25ºC and therefore it’s enthalpy change is zero. The air’s enthalpy change can usually be calculated with relative accuracy by using cp∆T. The cp value at the average temperature should be used. In the case above ( ) CT o mean 250~273 2 760298 − + = The value of cp can be found in the transport properties table on p28 of the CUED data book. Care should always be taken in deciding which of the above methods to use. Variations in cp can be significant at high temperatures. NB Be careful when applying the 1 st law to combustion. In the above analysis each term is on the basis of 1kmol of fuel. It should be noted that the enthalpy of reaction is a negative quantity (by definition), and is in MJ/Kg (not /kmol) in the data book.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
