Axial variation of convection heat transfer coefficient for flow in a tube. 2 A quick review of thermodynamics • Thermodynamics and heat transfer are highly complementary. • Many heat transfer problems do need a first law analysis. • First law of thermodynamics or balance of energy: The rate of increase in the amount of energy stored in a control volume must equal the rate at which energy enters the control volume, minus the rate at which energy leaves the control volume, plus the rate at which energy is generated within the control volume. • Mathematically: ∆ ሶ𝑬𝒔𝒕 = ሶ𝑬𝒊𝒏 − ሶ𝑬𝒐𝒖𝒕+ ሶ𝑬𝒈 ∆ ሶ𝑬𝒔𝒕: The rate of energy storage in the control volume ሶ𝑬𝒊𝒏 : The rate of energy transfer to the control volume ሶ𝑬𝒐𝒖𝒕: The rate of energy removal from the control volume ሶ𝑬𝒈: The rate of energy generated within the control volume 3 Conservation of energy in a control volume A quick review of thermodynamics, contd. • Energy can be carried to or from the control volume by: heat, work and mass flow. • For a steady state system, without internal energy generation (e.g. electrical resistance, exothermic chemical reactions): ሶ𝒎(𝒉 + 𝟏/𝟐𝑽𝟐+𝒈𝒛) 𝒊𝒏- ሶ𝒎(𝒉 + 𝟏/𝟐𝑽𝟐+𝒈𝒛) 𝒐𝒖𝒕+𝒒 − ሶ𝑾=0 ሶ𝑚 : mass flow rate (kg/s) h: specific enthalpy (J/kg) 1/2𝑉2+ 𝑔𝑧: specific kinetic and potential energies (J/kg) 𝑞 : net heat transfer rate to the control volume ሶ𝑊: net rate of work done by the control volume • If there is no work done and, the kinetic and potential energies are negligible and, the fluid is either a perfect gas or a liquid, then: 𝒒 = ሶ𝒎𝒄𝒑(𝑻𝒐𝒖𝒕 − 𝑻𝒊𝒏) • These conditions often hold in flow inside pipes and channels. 4 Energy balance • For flow of most fluids in a pipe 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝(𝑇𝑚,0 − 𝑇𝑚,𝑖) 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣: convective heat transfer rate (W/𝑚2) ሶ𝑚: mass flow rate of fluid (kg/𝑚3) 𝑐𝑝: specific heat capacity 𝑇𝑚,0 & 𝑇𝑚,𝑖: outlet and inlet mean temperatures of the fluid • This simple overall energy balance relates three important thermal variables (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣, 𝑇𝑚,0, 𝑇𝑚,𝑖). This is a general expression that applies irrespective of the nature of the surface thermal or tube flow conditions. • Applying the first law of thermodynamics to the element shown in the figure and recalling that the mean temperature is defined such that ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝𝑇𝑚 represents the true rate of thermal energy (or enthalpy) advection integrated over the cross-section 𝑑𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 𝑇𝑚 + 𝑑𝑇𝑚 − 𝑇𝑚 or 𝑑𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝𝑑𝑇𝑚 Control volume for internal flow in a tube. 5 • Note that 𝑑𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = 𝑞𝑠 ′′𝑃𝑑𝑥, where P is the surface perimeter (𝑃 = 𝜋𝐷 for a circular tube) and 𝑞𝑠 ′′ is the heat transfer flux. • Substituting from this equation into the differential energy balance (𝑑𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝𝑑𝑇𝑚), yields 𝑑𝑇𝑚 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑞𝑠 ′′𝑃 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 = 𝑃 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 ℎ[𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑚 𝑥 ] • Note that if 𝑇𝑠 > 𝑇𝑚, heat is transferred to the fluid and 𝑇𝑚 increases with x and if 𝑇𝑠 < 𝑇𝑚 the opposite is correct. • For constant heat flux: 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = 𝑞𝑠 ′′(𝑃. 𝐿) and therefore 𝑑𝑇𝑚 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑞𝑠 ′′𝑃 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 ≠ 𝑓(𝑥) • Integration from 𝑥 = 0, it follows that 𝑇𝑚 𝑥 = 𝑇𝑚,𝑖 + 𝑞𝑠 ′′𝑃 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 𝑥 𝑞𝑠 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 Axial temperature variations for heat transfer in a tube under constant heat flux 6 • For constant surface temperature, we define ∆𝑇 = 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑚, then 𝑞𝑠 ′′𝑃 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 = 𝑑𝑇𝑚 𝑑𝑥 = − 𝑑 ∆𝑇 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑃 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 ℎ∆𝑇 • Separating the variables and integrating, ׬∆𝑇𝑖 ∆𝑇𝑜 𝑑(∆𝑇) ∆𝑇 = − 𝑃 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 ׬0 𝐿 ℎ𝑑𝑥 • Or, ln ∆𝑇0 ∆𝑇𝑖 = − 𝑃𝐿 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 ( 1 𝐿 ׬0 𝐿 ℎ𝑑𝑥), • Recall that we defined the average coefficient of convections as ℎ𝐿 = 1 𝐿 ׬0 𝐿 ℎ𝑑𝑥, so ln ∆𝑇0 ∆𝑇𝑖 = − 𝑃𝐿 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 ℎ𝐿 𝑇𝑠=constant, where ℎ𝐿, or simply തℎ is the average value of h for the entire tube. By rearranging we can readily show that ∆𝑇0 ∆𝑇𝑖 = 𝑇𝑠−𝑇𝑚,𝑜 𝑇𝑠−𝑇𝑚,𝑖 = exp(− 𝑃𝐿 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 തℎ) 𝑇𝑠=constant Had we integrated from the tube inlet to some axial position x within the tube, we would have obtained the similar, but more general results that ∆𝑇0 ∆𝑇𝑖 = 𝑇𝑠−𝑇𝑚(𝑥) 𝑇𝑠−𝑇𝑚,𝑖 = exp(− 𝑃𝑥 ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 തℎ) 𝑇𝑠=constant where തℎ is now the average value of h from the tube inlet to x. 7 • Determination of an expression for the total heat transfer rate 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 is complicated by the exponential nature of temperature distribution. We can rewrite the overall energy balance as 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑚,𝑖 − 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑚,𝑜 = ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝(∆𝑇𝑖 − ∆𝑇𝑜) and substituting for ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝 from the previous equations, we obtain 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = തℎ𝐴𝑠∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 𝑇𝑠 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 where 𝐴𝑠 is the tube internal surface area (𝐴𝑠=𝑃. 𝐿) and ∆𝑇𝑙𝑚 is the log mean temperature difference, ∆𝑇𝑙𝑚≡ ∆𝑇𝑜−∆𝑇𝑖 ln(∆𝑇𝑜/∆𝑇𝑖) 𝑇𝑠 Convective heat transfer in fluid flow in a constant temperature tube 8 Example 1 9 We showed that a also, for constant surface temperature tube Combing the two: 10 Example 2 1112 the overall energy balance (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = ሶ𝑚𝑐𝑝(𝑇𝑚,0 − 𝑇𝑚,𝑖)) that 1314","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
