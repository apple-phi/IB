Wet etching • Immersion of the substrate in a liquid 2. Dry etching • Exposure to reactive species in the gas phase 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 3 Wet Etching • The wet etching of microstructures by immersion in a reactive chemical mixture involves three main steps 1. Transportation of reactants to the surface to be etched 2. Chemical reaction between the reactants and the surface 3. Transportation of reactant products away from the surface • If step 1 is the rate limiting step in the process then the reaction is said to be mass transfer limited, whist if step 2 is the rate limiting step, then the process is said to be reaction rate limited • Etching is characterised by: • Etching rate • Etch selectivity • Etch uniformity 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 4 • Isotropic Etching • Most wet chemical etches are isotropic in nature • In other word, they etch all crystal planes of a material at the same rate, and so a single etch rate can be used to describe the process • Therefore, assuming that the masking material is completely resistant to the etch (we will return to this assumption shortly), isotropic wet etching tends to produce a very characteristic undercut profile 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 5 • Isotropic etching is widely used for • Removal of work damaged surfaces • Rounding of sharp, anisotropically etched corners which can be a source of stress concentrations • Removal of roughness created by dry or anisotropic etches • Simple pattering • Creation of free standing structures by undercutting • It is of particular importance in the last two cases that only desired regions are actually etched • For this reason, it is important that the etching rate of the masking material is much slower than that of the material to be etched • A high degree of selectivity is therefore required • A large number of wet etches have been characterised for a range of MEMS materials, allowing a sensible choice of etchant for a particular system 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 62P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 7 • By way of an example, let us consider how we might create a freestanding silicon cantilever using only wet chemistry • We will need to find a sacrificial material that can be removed from underneath the cantilever without attacking the Si • A good candidate is silicon oxide that is readily attacked by buffered hydrofluoric acid (bHF) • SiO2 dissolves in HF according to the reaction SiO2 + 6HF  H2SiF6 + 2H2O • H2SiF6 is soluble in water, and so may be transported away from the reaction surface • bHF does not significantly etch Si, so we will be able to undercut a cantilever structure, however, we require some means of patterning a continuous layer of Si 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 8 • The most common etchants for silicon are mixtures of HF with an oxidising agent, such as nitric acid (HNO3) and either water or acetic acid (CH3COOH) • Initially silicon is oxidised in the presence of holes by Si + 2H+  Si2+ + H2 • Water is dissociated in the solution, H2O  (OH)- + H+ • and the hydroxyl ions combine with the positively charged silicon ions to form silicon oxide, Si2+ + 2(OH)-  Si(OH)2 Si(OH)2  SiO2 + H2(gas) • The surface layer of SiO2 formed on the silicon is then etched by the HF through reaction 10.1 • We can then construct the full fabrication process 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 9 Step 1 Start with a ‘silicon-on-insulator’ (SOI) wafer consisting of a 10 µm thick layer of silicon oxide on a silicon with a 0.5 µm layer of Si on top. A 2 µm thick layer of photoresist is added. Step 2 The photoresist is patterned to protect the cantilever, and a HNO :HF:CH COOH etch used to33 remove the unwanted poly-Si. Step 3 A bHF etch is then used to undercut the cantilever. Step 4 Finally, the remaining photoresist is removed by acetone. Acetone has a low surface tension, and so in drying does not cause the cantilever to collapse. 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 10 • Anisotropic Etching • Whilst most wet etches are isotropic, in some cases the wet chemical etch rate varies with crystallographic orientation, resulting in anisotropy • In the case of silicon, the most common anisotropic etchants are strong bases 1. Aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) (sometimes with isopropyl alcohol, IPA) 2. Tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TmAH) 3. Ethylene diamine pyrochatecol (EDP) Etch Rate [µm hr-1] Etchant Temper- ature [°C] Si(100) Si(110) Si(111) KOH: H2O 80 84 126 0.21 KOH 75 25-42 39-66 0.5 EDP 110 51 57 1.25 N2H4 H2O 118 176 99 11 NH4OH 75 24 8 1 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 11 • Orientation dependence is a consequence of the fact that different crystalline surfaces will have varying structures • The (111) surface of c-Si is particularly stable as a silicon atom on the surface will only have one of its four bonds pointing out of the surface with the other three pointing back into the bulk of the material • This results in a stable surface with a high surface density of atoms • As KOH etching, for example, proceeds by the insertion of an OH group into a Si—Si bond, the etch rate of the Si(111) surface is suppressed 110 110 100 100 111 111 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 12 • The result of this is that if a masking pattern is produced on the surface of a Si(100) wafer with sides in the <110> directions, then a groove will be etched with sides at an angle of 54.7° with respect to the surface plane • For short etching times, rectangular features will yield U-shaped grooves with (111) oriented sidewalls and a (100) oriented base 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 13 • The etch will proceed with time until only stable (111) surfaces remain • Rectangular features will produce v-grooves, whilst square patterns will produce inverted pyramids 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 14 • So far, all the edges between (111) planes have been concave, and these edges are essentially stable in the KOH etch • However, convex edges are not stable and are efficiently undercut • The allows the fabrication of free standing structures without the need for a sacrificial layer between the superstructure and the substrate 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 15 • Alternatively, structures with vertical sidewalls may be produced by orienting rectangular sides with the <100> directions • In this case, the initial etching into the silicon bulk will reveal (100) sidewalls as well as the (100) base • All surfaces will be etched at the same rate • Therefore, the surface mask will be undercut on all four sides, with the undercut distance being the same as the etch depth to a good first approximation • Unlike the previous example, so stable (111) facets are exposed, so this process is not self-limiting<100> 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 16 • The following points should be noted regarding anisotropic etching using KOH 1. The highest etch rate is achieved for a 20% solution at ~85° C 2. KOH will efficiently remove most photoresists, and so it is necessary to use a ‘hard mask’ • This involves using a material on the surface of the silicon, such as silicon nitride or silicon oxide, which is first patterned using a standard photoresist 3. KOH will slowly etch most hard mask materials, so if a deep silicon etch is being performed, the hard mask material must be of sufficient thickness to survive the etching process (see Slide 6) 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 17 • Etch Stops • If a wet etching process has been well characterised, then it should be possible to etch features of a certain depth knowing the etching rate • In practice, this is more difficult than it sounds • The effective concentration of the etchant may decrease with use • When does the etch begin and end? • Some wetting time may be necessary and certainly some etchant removal time • Therefore, if the depth of a feature is a critical parameter, some method of precisely controlling the end of an etch – an etch stop process – will be necessary • Dielectric etch stop • Dielectrics, such as silicon nitride, tend to have a reduced etch rate compared to silicon • A layer may then be introduced underneath the layer to be etched to ensure that the etch terminates at the correct depth • However, this requires the use of an extra material (and hence deposition step) in the process 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 18 • Doping selective etching (DSE) • Silicon which has been heavily doped with boron to a concentration of ~1026 m-3 has a significantly reduced anisotropic etch rate • Therefore, an etch of a low doped p-type or n-type silicon layer will naturally halt on a heavily boron doped layer, resulting in a very smooth surface • However, the addition of boron tends to cause a significant intrinsic stress in the silicon, which limits the use of these layers as mechanical components 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 19 • Bias selective etching (BSE) • This is otherwise known as an electrochemical etch stop • A positively biased silicon wafer will be oxidised in an etchant solution to form a protective oxide layer which will prevent etching • A current is required for the oxide to form, therefore, a reverse biased pn junction in the solution will not be able to form a passivation layer until all of the p or n- type material has been removed • At this point a current may flow, and the silicon surface will quickly oxidise, stopping the etch at the change in doping density 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 20 Dry Etching • An alternative to wet etching of materials is the use of gas phase etchants • These so-called dry etching processes have the advantage that the use of a continuous flow of gas naturally removes unwanted reaction products from the surface • It also ensures a constant etch rate, as used etchant is constantly replaced • The etching process may be quickly terminated by pumping away the reactant gases, allowing a more accurate determination of etch time • Residual gas analysis of the reaction products may be used to determine when a particular layer has been fully etched • The danger of surface tension in a liquid breaking mechanical micro-components is removed 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 21 • Vapour Etching • Xenon difluoride (XeF2) is a highly selective vapour etchant for silicon • It requires no excitation, and does not etch silicon dioxide or most metals • It is an isotropic etch and so may be used in conjunction with sacrificial polycrystalline silicon to produce released surface structures • The reaction proceeds according to 2XeF2 + Si  2Xe + SiF4 • Etching normally takes place under a clean vacuum as XeF2 will react with water, and so the sample should also be dehydrated prior to etching • The etch takes place at a pressure between 1Torr and the vapour pressure of XeF2 (~3.8 Torr at 25° C) • Silicon can be etched at a rate of ~300 nm min-1 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 22 • Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) • In RIE, the reactant gas is excited to form a plasma which contains the reactive species required to perform the etch • The bombardment of the surface top be etched by ions from the plasma can lead to sputter enhancement of the etch rate • Although there are many plasma sources for performing RIE, the most common is rf-RIE • This system is identical to an rf-PECVD system (as used for a-Si:H deposition – see Lecture 9, Slide 17) however, the substrate is placed on the rf-driven electrode, as the energy of ions impacting this electrode is greater due to its negative self-bias with respect to earth Material Etch Gas c-Si, a-Si, poly-Si CF4, SF6 Silicon oxide CF4/H2 Silicon nitride CF4/O2 Organics O2, O2/CF4, SF6 Aluminium BCl3 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 23 • At high pressures, ions crossing the plasma sheath undergo many collisions, and so strike the etch surface with a broad range of incident angles, and a fairly isotropic etch results • SF6 makes a particularly good isotropic etch for silicon • The high pressure also means that the flux of reactant species is high and the etch rate is also increased • At low pressures, ions are accelerated across the sheath without collision, and so tend to hit the etch surface at close to normal incidence • Side walls are therefore only weakly etched, and an anisotropic etch results • CF4 makes a particularly good anisotropic etch for silicon as it also coats the side walls with a protective fluorine polymer, which is only removed by ion bombardment • A thin fluorine polymer layer may sometimes be left even on the etched faces at the end of a CF4 plasma etch, and so O2 is often added to the gas mixture to remove this polymer layer 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 24 • Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) • Standard RIE tends to produce etch rates between 10 and 100 nm min-1 • Whilst this is sufficient for surface micromachining, it is far to slow to allow a layer hundreds of µm thick to be etched • DRIE received an impetus thanks to research carried out at Bosch, where a cyclic process involving two important stages was developed for deep isotropic etching • In the first stage of the BOSCH process, a dense SF6 plasma is used to etch a thin layer of silicon • In the second stage, a C4F8 plasma is used to deposit a thin fluorine polymer on the etched surface • When SF6 is reintroduced, it preferentially removes the polymer from the bottom of the etch structure, exposing the silicon in this region and allowing the etch to proceed • The sidewalls, however, remain protected and are not etched 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 25 • In this way, deep structures may be produced with vertical sidewalls at an etch rate of up to 20 µm min-1 in bulk c-Si • DRIE has enabled the production of a range of new 3D microsystem structures, including the MIT microturbine http://www-mtl.mit.edu/mtlhome/6Res/AR1999/AR99-MEM.pdf SF6 CF48 SF6 1 2 Silicon substrate Hard mask 1 2 2P8: Electrical Engineering: Lecture 12 – Transparency 26 Other Etching Techniques • Both dry and wet etching techniques require some means of protecting certain areas of a sample which must not be etched, and this normally requires photolithography • However, several techniques exist for removing material without the need for prior patterining • In ion milling systems, a focussed beam of Ar (or other suitable) ions is directed at a substrate allowing material to be locally removed by sputtering • In laser micromachining systems, a high power laser pulse is focussed on the material to be removed • The material is locally heated and sublimes, allowing a structure to be formed • Whilst such techniques are good for prototyping, direct writing of patterns is slow and not commercially acceptable","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
