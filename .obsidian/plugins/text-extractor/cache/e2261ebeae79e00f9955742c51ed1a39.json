The key dimensions of the optical sub- system—d, r and h—provide these features when implemented with PDMS as the optical material (Supplementary Fig. 7). The combined heightsofthemicrolenses,supportingpostsandbasemembrane(thatis, r1h1t) position the photodiodes at distances of one focal length (f 5rn/(n21)5r1h1t) from the lens surface. Collimated light at normal incidence focuses to spot sizes that are smaller (about 100mm 3100mm) than the areas of the photodiodes. Retaining these optical parameters throughout the process of trans- formation fromplanar to hemispherical shapes represents a challenge that can be addressed with two new design/integration approaches. The first approach involves a method for bonding the optical and electrical subsystems at the positions of the photodiodes/blocking diodes only. This configuration ensures optical alignment during sub- sequent deformation, but allows free motion of the serpentine inter- connects to minimize their effects on the overall mechanics. The resulting response of the system to applied force is dominated by the elastic behaviour of the PDMS (modulus about 1MPa), and is nearly independent of the hard materials found in the array of photodiodes/ blocking diodes (Si, with modulus about 150GPa, Au, with modulus about 80GPa and polyimide, with modulus about 5GPa) 27,28 . In par- ticular, the computed effective modulus of the systemis only 1.9MPa, with global strains that can reach more than 50% in equi-biaxial ten- sion before exceeding the fracture thresholds of the materials. The second approach exploits a set of dimensional and material choices in the optical subsystem. Here, the modulus of the PDMS is sufficientlysmall andtheheightsofthesupportingpostsaresufficiently large that deformations induced by stretching the base membrane are almost entirely mechanically decoupled from the microlenses. As a result, large strains created by geometry transformation induce no measurable change in the focusing properties. In addition, the com- bined heights of the microlenses and the posts are large compared to thethicknessof thebasemembrane. Thislayout minimizesstrainatthe locations of bonding with the photodiodes/blocking diodes, thereby eliminatingthepossibilityforfailureat theseinterfacesorinthesilicon. Figure 2 summarizes these features in a series of micro X-ray com- puted tomography (XCT; MicroXCT 400) images and finite element method (FEM) calculations before and after geometrical transforma- tion (see Supplementary Figs 9 and 10 for additional details of FEM and analytical treatments of the mechanics). The results in Fig. 2c highlight four adjacent ommatidia, with strain distributions deter- mined by FEMin each of the different layers of a single ommatidium. The top and bottomsurfaces, where the microlenses and photodiodes are located, respectively, show excellent isolation. The peak strains in these regions are ,1% (microlenses in box of Fig. 2c) and ,0.2% (photodiode/blockingdiodesinboxof Fig. 2c)evenforthelargeglobal strains (about 30% or more) that occur in the hemispherical shape. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of r across the entire array, before and after deformation (top panels of Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 12) shows no change, which is consistent with FEM findings (Supplementary Fig. 13). Non-uniform strains lead to a slight, but systematic, spatial variation of DWacross the array (bottomleft panel of Fig. 2d), as expected based on the mechanics (Supplementary Fig. 13). All ommatidia have an orientation along the direction of the surface normal (that is, the tilt from normal, h tilt , is zero; bottom right panel of Fig. 2d).

Rogers 1,4 In arthropods, evolution has created a remarkably sophisticated class of imaging systems, with a wide-angle field of view, low aber- rations, high acuity to motion and an infinite depth of field 1–3 .A challenge in building digital cameras with the hemispherical, com- pound apposition layouts of arthropod eyes is that essential design requirements cannot be met with existing planar sensor technolo- gies or conventional optics. Here we present materials, mechanics and integration schemes that afford scalable pathways to working, arthropod-inspired cameras with nearly full hemispherical shapes (about 160 degrees). Their surfaces are densely populated by imag- ing elements (artificial ommatidia), which are comparable in number (180) to those of the eyes of fire ants (Solenopsis fugax ) and bark beetles 4,5 (Hylastes nigrinus ). The devices combine elasto- meric compound optical elements with deformable arrays of thin silicon photodetectors into integrated sheets that can be elastically transformed from the planar geometries in which they are fabricated to hemispherical shapes for integration into apposition cameras. Our imaging results and quantitative ray-tracing-based simulations illustrate key features of operation. These general strategies seem to be applicable to other compound eye devices, such as those inspired by moths and lacewings 6,7 (refracting superposition eyes), lobster and shrimp 8 (reflecting superposition eyes), and houseflies 9 (neural superposition eyes). Improved understanding of light-sensing organs in biology 1,10–12 creates opportunities for the development of cameras that adopt similar engineering principles, to provide operational characteristics beyond those available with existing technologies 13–19 . The compound eyes of arthropods are particularly notable for their exceptionally wide fields of view, high sensitivity to motion and infinite depth of field 1–3 .Analo- gous man-made cameras with these characteristics have been of long- standing interest, owing to their potential for use in surveillance devices, tools for endoscopy and other demanding applications. Previous work demonstrates devices that incorporate compound lens systems, but only in planar geometries or in large-scale, handmade curved replicas 20–24 . Constraints intrinsic to such approaches prevent the realization of cameras with the key features present in arthropod eyes: full hemi- spherical shapes in compact, monolithic forms, with scalability in size, number and configuration of the light-sensing elements (ommatidia). Here we present a complete set of materials, design layouts and integration schemes for digital cameras that mimic hemispherical appo- sition compound eyes found in biology. Certain of the concepts extend recent advances in stretchable electronics 25 and hemispherical photo- detector arrays 13–18 , in overall strategies that provide previously unac- hievable options in design. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies of the mechanical and optical properties of working devices reveal the essential aspects of fabrication and operation. Figure 1a presents schematic illustrations of the two main subsys- tems and methods for their assembly into working hemispherical apposition cameras. The first subsystem provides optical imaging func- tion and defines the overall mechanics; it is a moulded piece of the elastomer poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS, with index of refraction n < 1.43) that consists of an array of 16 3 16 convex microlenses (with radius of curvature of each microlens r < 400 mm) over a square area of 14.72 mm 3 14.72 mm, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Of the 256 microlenses, 180 form working components of the camera, each on a matching cylindrical supporting post (of height h < 400 mm) con- nected to a base membrane (of thickness t < 550 mm). The second subsystem enables photodetection and electrical read- out; it consists of a matching array of thin, silicon photodiodes (active areas d 2 < 160 mm 3 160 mm) and blocking diodes in an open mesh configuration with capability for matrix addressing. Narrow filamen- tary serpentine traces of metal (Cr/Au) encapsulated by polyimide serve as electrical and mechanical interconnects. Aligned bonding of these two subsystems places each photodiode at the focal position of a corresponding microlens (Fig. 1b), to yield an integrated imaging system. A key feature enabled by the constituent materials and layouts is a fully isotropic elastic mechanical response to large strain defor- mation, in any direction. In consequence, hydraulic actuation can deterministically transform the planar layout in which these separate subsystems are constructed and bonded together, into a full hemi- spherical shape (Fig. 1c), with precise engineering control (radius of curvature of the hemisphere R < 6.96 mm) and without any change in optical alignment or adverse effect on electrical or optical performance (see Supplementary Figs 2 and 3 for details). A complete apposition camera (Fig. 1d) consists of this type of imager, combined with a top perforated sheet and a bottom bulk support, both made of black silicone to eliminate stray light, bonded to the outer and inner surfaces, respectively (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 8). A thin film insert with metallized contact pads connects to a printed circuit board as an interface to external control electronics. By analogy to imaging organs in arthropods 12 , each microlens and supporting post corresponds to a corneal lens and crystalline cone, respectively; each photodiode is a rhabdom; the black elastomer serves as the screening pigment. A collected set of each of these elements represents an ommatidium. The dimensions and the mechanical properties of the imaging sys- tem are critically important for proper operation. The acceptance angle (DQ) and the inter-ommatidial angle (DW) define the nature of image formation 1,26 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 4). Each microlens focuses light incident on it within a cone defined by DQ. An individual ommatidium samples an angular object space determined by DW.
