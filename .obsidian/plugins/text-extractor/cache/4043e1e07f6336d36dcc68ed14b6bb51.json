In weeks 5-8 we will apply the fundamental principles of materials thermodynamics and diffusion learnt in weeks 1-4 to explain how manufacturing processes can be used to manipulate the microstructure and properties of materials. Process variables (inputs): • material type • composition • thermal history • deformation history The aim is to develop a more detailed understanding of how key process variables interact to deliver the required properties, for different classes of material: Microstructure: • phases present • spatial distribution • grain size / shape • dislocation density Material properties (outputs): • stiffness (Young’s modulus) • yield strength ( 𝜎𝑦 ) • fracture toughness ( 𝐾𝐼𝐶 ) Lectures 9-11: Heat Treatment • Heat treatment of metal alloys: Al alloys, steels strength, toughness • Diffusion in heat treatment Image: Ashby, Shercliff & Cebon, Materials Engineering, Science, Processing & Design Lectures 12-14: Shaping Processes • Casting of metals: alloy choice cast microstructures The typical range of processing steps was introduced in Part IA.

Heat treatment of aluminium alloys Aluminium (Al) alloys belong to the family of ‘light alloys’ (which includes titanium and magnesium). They play an important role in the design of lightweight components and structures. Aluminium has a density and stiffness about 1/3 that of steel: However, pure aluminium is soft (low strength): 𝜎𝑦 = 40 MPa For structural applications, the strength can be increased by a factor of 10 through alloying and heat treatment. High strength aluminium alloys are particularly important for weight reduction in transport applications (automotive, aerospace, rail, marine). 𝜌 = 2700 kg/m3, 𝐸 = 70 GPa Alcoa/Audi spaceframe formed Al extrusions die-cast Al joints Jaguar F-Type Image courtesy of Alcoa Recall from IA the key points for precipitation hardening: • The yield stress is inversely proportional to the obstacle spacing. • It also depends on the strength of the obstacle. ‘Weak’ dislocation pinning ‘Strong’ dislocation pinning The most important hardening mechanism for high strength Al alloys is precipitation hardening – pinning of dislocations by strong, second phase particles. Heat treatment processes can be used to manipulate the precipitation phase transformation to produce strong, tough microstructures. 5 2.1 Composition range for heat treatable Al alloys Aluminium can be combined with a variety of other elements, resulting in a large family of alloys. We will use Al-Cu alloys here as an example, as it is commonly heat treated to improved its strength. The phase diagram can be used to identify suitable alloy compositions for heat treatment, and critical temperatures for the heat treatment process. The key requirements for heat-treatable alloys are: • At high temperature: single phase solid solution (high solubility of alloy additions) • At low temperature: two-phase region (low solubility of alloy additions) • A solvus line (solubility limit) is crossed on cooling, driving precipitation of the second phase, which is required for precipitation hardening. Al-Cu phase diagram single phase solid solution two-phase region (Al) The fall in solubility of the (Al) phase on cooling is the key feature of the phase diagram being exploited for precipitation hardened alloys. Recall from Teach Yourself Phase Diagrams that slow cooling allows time for the equilibrium microstructure to form: • Below the solvus line, a two-phase mixture has the lowest Gibbs free energy, and so a phase transformation occurs: (Al) → (Al) + CuAl2 • Cu is rejected from the single phase (Al) solid to form CuAl2 precipitates. The driving force for precipitation is the reduction in Gibbs free energy. Diffusion enables the transformation to occur. • Precipitates nucleate most easily heterogeneously on grain boundaries (more space in the Al lattice, faster diffusion). The largest precipitates will occur here. Precipitates can also nucleate homogeneously within the grains. solubility limit 6 However, this slow-cooled microstructure provides ineffective precipitation hardening: • Precipitates are large and spaced far apart. Precipitate coarsening is driven by Gibbs free energy, as it reduces the interface area (and interface energy penalty) per unit precipitate volume. Slow cooling gives time for this coarsening to occur. • They provide ineffective obstacles to dislocations: 𝜎𝑦 ∝ 1 / obstacle spacing • The overall rate of transformation depends on the rates of nucleation and growth. • This in turn depends on the undercooling: Δ𝑇 = 𝑇𝐸 − 𝑇 TE T TE T • Small Δ𝑇 → small Δ𝐺 → low thermodynamic driving force. • Large Δ𝑇 → low thermal energy → rearrangement of atoms by diffusion is slow. • The peak rate occurs at an intermediate temperature. It is convenient in materials processing to invert the rate axis and show instead the time taken for a certain fraction to transform (‘C-curve’). The plot of fraction transformed for a given temperature and time is known as a Time Temperature Transformation (TTT) diagram. The same principles govern precipitation in the aluminium alloy: TE for (Al) as the equilibrium phase: solvus line (Al) stable (Al) + CuAl2 2.2 Rapid cooling of Al alloys (quenching) Consider next the effect of increasing the cooling rate of the alloy, from the single- phase solid solution. Recall from earlier lectures that phase transformation rate depends on temperature and time, as follows: 7 • A key piece of information shown by the CCT diagram is the critical cooling rate (CCR). • This is the slowest cooling rate that just avoids the C-curves. • Cooling at this rate or faster means that no precipitation phase transformation occurs. There is insufficient time or temperature for nucleation of precipitates. Material cooled faster than the critical cooling rate will therefore remain a single phase solid solution at room temperature: Note that TTT diagrams apply to isothermal transformations only (i.e. with the specimen held at a fixed temperature). In practical heat treatment processes, continuous cooling is more likely to occur. There is an analogous continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram, where the C-curves show the fraction transformed for a fixed cooling rate. single phase solid solution (stable; equilibrium) (Al) (Al) Above TE (above the solvus line): This is not the equilibrium state: it is a “metastable” micro-structure. There is more Cu trapped in the Al lattice than the equilibrium amount, and it is therefore known as a supersaturated solid solution (SSSS). This results in a material with effective solid solution hardening. It has a higher yield strength than the slow-cooled alloy with the coarse precipitates. However, this is still not the optimum microstructure for maximum strength. Room temperature: single phase supersaturated solid solution (metastable; not equilibrium) quench 𝑑𝑇 𝑑𝑡 ≥ CCR (Al) stable (Al) + CuAl2 8 2.3 Age hardening A higher yield strength than either slow-cooled or quenched alloys can be achieved by a process known as age hardening. The aim of this heat treatment process is to achieve precipitation hardening, but compared to slow cooling we want: • precipitates that are smaller and more closely spaced, • more effective obstacles to dislocations. The process consists of three steps: (1) solution heat treatment • dissolve alloying elements, to achieve single phase solid solution (2) quenching • cool faster than the CCR, forming a supersaturated solid solution (SSSS) (3) ageing • re-heat, allowing time for precipitation to occur from the metastable SSSStemperature time There are two options for the ageing step: • artificial ageing: re-heat for a few hours at around 150-200°C (which still keeps the material within the two-phase region on the phase diagram), • natural ageing: leave for several days at room temperature. During the ageing step, precipitates nucleate and grow. The size and spacing of the precipitates can be controlled by varying the ageing time and temperature. With increasing ageing time, the precipitates coarsen: average size and spacing ↑ • Driven by Gibbs free energy: coarsening reduces the (Al) / precipitate interface area (interface energy penalty). • Higher ageing temperature means: - more rapid coarsening - but a lower equilibrium fraction of precipitates (from the phase diagram). 9 As the precipitates grow, the effectiveness of the precipitation hardening changes: • When the precipitates are small, dislocations easily shear through them. They are weak obstacles. • As they grow, the shearing resistance increases with the radius of the precipitate, until the dislocation breaking angle falls to zero. • Typically: strength ∝ radius1/2 precipitate shearing radius ↑ ⇒ strength ↑ • As the precipitates get large, the spacing also gets large (the volume fraction of precipitates initially increases but then remains fixed). • Strength is now dominated by dislocations “bypassing” obstacles (breaking and reforming of the dislocation) • Strength ∝ 1 / spacing ∝ 1 / radius precipitate radius, r shearing bypassing dislocation bypassing radius ↑ ⇒ strength ↓ shear stress to overcome obstacle These two effects trade off as the precipitates grow: precipitate shearing dominates the strength at first, then bypassing. A peak in resistance is seen when the two mechanisms swap over. The strength of the material varies with ageing time as shown: • Artificial ageing: yield stress rises to a ‘peak aged’ condition, and then falls to a soft ‘overaged’ state (which is similar to the slow cooled material). • Natural ageing: the low temperature means slow diffusion, and precipitates remain small; yield stress rises more slowly, to an intermediate plateau value. 10 2.4 Age hardening: further microstructural details We will look more closely now at the details of this age hardening process. This is important to understand why some aluminium alloys age harden in this way, but some do not (the latter are known as “non-heat-treatable” alloys). • A first look at the TTT diagram suggests there would be no precipitation during ageing – the time to produce CuAl2 is very long at ageing temperatures. = (Al) • However: metastable (non- equilibrium) precipitates can form at these low temperatures (even at room temperature). • There is another set of C-curves governing the precipitation of these metastable phases. Experimental evidence from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of high-strength aerospace Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy (artificially aged): (a) initial precipitation (b) peak aged (c) over aged (note scale: cf. diameter of Al atom = 0.28 nm) Source: Poole W.J., Shercliff H.R. and Castillo T., Mat. Sci. Tech. 13, Nov. 1997, pp.897-904 Note that in natural ageing, the microstructure evolution stops at a point similar to (a) above. There is insufficient thermal energy for ageing to continue, and the material remains “underaged” (but with useful strength, and with lower processing cost). 11 • Overall, it becomes energetically favourable for the precipitates to transform through a whole sequence of metastable phases, eventually reaching equilibrium CuAl2 , with a progressive loss of coherency at the interface. • This is the result of a tradeoff between the interface energy penalty (coherent vs incoherent) and the volumetric Gibbs free energy penalty (of metastable precipitates vs equilibrium CuAl2).incoherent Al lattice precipitate Metastable precipitates have a different crystal structure to equilibrium CuAl2 : • The precipitate is coherent, i.e. its crystal lattice matches that of the Al closely. This reduces the interface energy penalty to nucleation. • Because slip planes are continuous across the interface, dislocations easily cut through these precipitates (the “shearing” mechanism). • They are weak obstacles, with a high dislocation breaking angle. Al lattice precipitate coherent As coarsening proceeds, coherency increasingly strains the lattice: Non-heat-treatable Al alloys: • Some alloys, due to their composition, do not form these metastable precipitates at lower temperatures. • Precipitates only form with very slow cooling, which would give coarse precipitates, providing negligible hardening. Even a modest quench will retain a 100% super-saturated solid solution. • So, they rely on solid solution and work hardening. • Examples include: Al-Mg (‘5000 series’), Al-Mg-Mn (‘3000 series’). The precipitates at the peak-aged state will be fine metastable precipitates, with larger equilibrium CuAl2 precipitates occurring in the over-aged material. 12 2.6 Quiz W5.1: heat treatment of Al alloys Samples of a heat treatable aluminium alloy are initially held at high temperature until they become a single-phase solid solution.

Heat treatment of steel Steels (Fe-C alloys) are the most widely used class of engineering alloys. In this section we will consider how heat treatment can be used to manipulate their microstructure and mechanical properties. Steels are an important engineering alloy due to their stiffness, strength and low cost, though this comes with a high density: Images: Corus media gallery alloy steel, heat treated up to 𝜎𝑦 ≈ 2000 MPa mild steel 𝜎𝑦 ≈ 300 MPa 𝜌 = 8000 kg/m3, 𝐸 = 210 GPa Mild steels (0.1-0.2 wt% C) are ubiquitous structural materials. Alloying and heat treatment can be used to produce extremely hard steels, useful for cutting tools, wear resistant gears etc. The key region of the phase diagram for the heat treatment of steels is shown below. Typical steel compositions lie in the range ~0.1 - 2 wt% C. ‘Mild steels’ have a low C concentration, ~0.1-0.2 wt% C. In what follows, we focus on hypo-eutectoid steels: those with composition <0.8 wt %. single phase region two phase region Like Al alloys, the heat treatment of steels involves moving between single and two- phase regions of the phase diagram. However, unlike the precipitation phase trans- formation in Al alloys, steel involves a three-phase reaction: • FCC Austenite ( γ ) → BCC Ferrite ( α ) + Fe3C 14 3.1 Slow cooled steel The microstructures of slow cooled steels were introduced in Teach Yourself Phase Diagrams. A brief recap is provided here. Slow-cooled steels are referred to as normalised. Hot- rolled steel is often in this condition. Image: Corus media gallery (A) the material enters the two-phase α + γ region at around 800°C; – the ferrite α rejects carbon into the austenite γ; (B) at the eutectoid temperature, the austenite (now containing 0.8wt% C) transforms to the microstructure pearlite, containing the phases ferrite α + cementite Fe3C. Microstructure evolution on slow cooling for a Fe – 0.4 wt% C steel: A B The properties of normalised hypo-eutectoid steels are determined by the carbon content: • The carbon content affects the proportion of ferrite and pearlite: the level rule, applied just above the eutectoid temperature, gives the proportion of austenite, which transforms into pearlite on further cooling. • Cementite is very hard, and the pearlite structure obstructs dislocation motion effectively. So, the higher the pearlite fraction, the harder the material. • Low carbon steels have only a small proportion of pearlite, and have a yield stress around 200 MPa, which is combined with high ductility. This is the lower end of the strength range. • Normalised eutectoid steel (100% pearlite) has a yield stress around 450 MPa, but with lower ductility. This is the upper end of the strength range. 3.2 TTT diagrams for hypo-eutectoid steels Just like Al alloys, cooling rate has a significant effect on the microstructure and properties of steel. We can use the TTT diagram to assess the influence of temperature and time on the phase transformations. The TTT diagram for 0.4 wt% C, hypo- eutectoid steel is shown below, alongside the phase diagram for comparison: Fe-C phase diagram Note: T axes aligned The various transformations (i)-(iv) shown on the TTT diagram are now described in turn: (a) Diffusion-controlled transformations (higher temperatures): austenite, γ → ferrite, α + cementite, Fe3C (equilibrium phases) TTT diagram has the conventional C-curve shape for diffusional phase transformations at higher temperatures, with the following details (for hypo-eutectoid steels): (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (ii) above the “nose” of the C-curves, and below the “A1 temperature”, 723°C: • ferrite forms first (from austenite grain boundaries) • transformation switches from ferrite to pearlite at the carbide line; • final microstructure: ferrite + pearlite (i) above the “nose” of the C-curves, and above the “A1 temperature”, 723°C: • ferrite forms first (from austenite grain boundaries) • final microstructure: ferrite + austenite (proportions given by the tie line) Microstructure: A quench-and-hold close to (and below) the A1 temperature is essentially very similar to slow continuous cooling, as discussed above. Shown right is the final microstructure for case (ii). 15 (iii) below the “nose” of the C-curves: diffusion is more inhibited • austenite transforms directly to ferrite + iron carbide, in a fine-scale dispersion • this microstructure is called bainite. Microstructure: Bainite nucleates on the austenite grain boundaries, with simultaneous growth of ferrite and iron carbide, giving a fine-scale dispersion of iron carbide needles within a ferrite matrix (rather than the lamellar structure of pearlite). (b) Diffusionless transformation (lower temperatures): austenite, γ → martensite, α’ (metastable phase) Quenching carbon steels to bypass the nose of the C-curves (i.e. faster than the Critical Cooling Rate) prevents diffusive phase transformations from taking place. Instead there is a transformation to a metastable phase called martensite (α’): case (iv) . • Quenching produces a supersaturated solid solution of C in Fe, i.e. there is more carbon trapped in the Fe lattice than the equilibrium amount (similar to the Al alloy case). • However, in contrast to Al alloys, iron is FCC at high temperatures (austenite), but BCC at low temperatures (ferrite). Therefore the SSSS is also initially in the ‘wrong’ atomic packing, compared to equilibrium. • To overcome this, the material can get closer to BCC without diffusion, by a modest distortion (straining) of the lattice. This is the martensite phase transformation. This lattice shape change is achieved by shear – narrow regions shear across the austenite grain (at the speed of sound in the material, effectively instantaneously), leaving a needle of the martensite phase within the austenite grain. needle of martensite C remains in solid solution lattice shears growth direction 16 This transformation takes place without diffusion: • there is no time-dependence on the TTT diagram, • the contours of fraction transformed are horizontal lines. However, the fraction transformed does depend on the temperature: • Martensite begins to form at the “martensite start temperature”, Ms • Reducing the temperature further increases the fraction of austenite that transforms to martensite. • The transformation is complete at the “martensite finish temperature”, MF lower temperature: larger fraction transformed This is for thermodynamic reasons: • As the temperature falls, at a temperature well below A1 (see above), the Gibbs free energy of the martensite phase becomes lower than the austenite phase: there is a thermodynamic driving force (Δ𝐺) for the martensite phase transformation. • A certain degree of undercooling (and hence Δ𝐺) is needed to start the transformation. This occurs at the martensite start temperature. • At a given temperature, the transformation of a percentage of the austenite into martensite can reduce the free energy sufficiently to stop further transformation. • The undercooling (and Δ𝐺) must be increased further to induce further transformation. This completes at the martensite finish temperature. 17 Example: reading from the TTT diagram for a hypo-eutectoid steel Estimate the final microstructure for the hypo-eutectoid steel with the TTT diagram shown below, subject to the following heat treatment: • Austenitise (i.e. solution heat treat) for 30 minutes at 850˚C • Quench to 630˚C, hold for 10 minutes, quench to room temperature. (a) (b) (c) (d) γ → pearlite ( α + Fe3C ) γ → bainite austenite ( γ ) γ → martensite ( α’ ) γ → ferrite ( α ) carbide line: • ferrite growth stops when the carbide line is reached, and pearlite growth begins Note that no martensite transformation occurs between (c) and (d), as there is no austenite left at (c) to transform on quenching. It has all transformed to ferrite and pearlite, which is unaffected by the quench. C-curves: • show the total % of austenite that has transformed • interpolate linearly, perpendicular to the contours, to estimate the fraction at a given point Point Total % transformed (from the C - curves) Transformed phases Balance (a) 0 % (b) 40 % (c) 100 % (d) 100 % none 100% austenite 40% ferrite 60% austenite 40% ferrite + 60% pearlite none 40% ferrite + 60% pearlite none 18 (1) The proportion of ferrite to pearlite decreases: • This follows the phase diagram, and the lever rule applied just before the eutectoid transformation (see examples paper 1). • At the eutectoid composition, the ferrite region has disappeared altogether: the carbide line on the TTT diagram merges with the curve for the start of transformation, which goes straight to pearlite above the nose. TTT diagram: eutectoid steel (2) The C-curves move to longer times: • The greater amount of C to redistribute delays all of the diffusional transformations. (3) The martensite start and finish temperatures decrease: • More carbon in supersaturated solid solution means more lattice strain. • This requires a greater undercooling to achieve the martensite transformation. wt % C 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.20 200 400 600 T ( ˚C ) Ms Mf Note that for eutectoid steel, Mf is -50˚C. At room temperature, a quenched specimen will therefore contain a fraction of retained austenite. 19 3.3 Effect of carbon content on the steel TTT diagram As the carbon content of hypo-eutectoid steel increases (between ≈0.1 and 0.8 wt% C), there are systematic changes to the TTT diagram: 3.4 Properties of bainite and martensite Recall that slow cooled (‘normalised’) hypo-eutectoid steels have a yield strength dependent on the carbon concentration (and hence pearlite fraction) in the range: Bainite has the ideal microstructure for effective precipitation hardening: a fine-scale dispersion of hard precipitates (Fe3C). Also, all grains have the same micro- structure and strength. Yield strengths are in the range: Martensite has a very high yield strength (i.e. high hardness): • The BCC Fe lattice is heavily supersaturated with carbon. This gives solid solution hardening. • This is further enhanced by the distortion of the lattice, as many interstitial holes contain C atoms that are too large to fit. • The higher the C content, the greater the distortion of the lattice, and the higher the hardness. more carbon more distortion of Fe lattice = harder martensite It is also extremely brittle. For practical purposes, it can be considered to have negligible fracture toughness (< 5 MPa.m1/2). 20 3.5 Quenching and tempering of carbon steels Martensite is rarely used in its as-quenched form: the low toughness means the component would shatter easily. Hence, it needs to be tempered: re-heated to a temperature of order 450-600°C (still in the two-phase α + Fe3C region on the phase diagram) to encourage diffusion. 𝜎𝑦 ≈ 200 - 450 MPa (0.1 - 0.8 wt% C) 𝜎𝑦 ≈ 500 - 700 MPa 𝜎𝑦 ≈ 1000 - 3000 MPa Tempering has the following effects: • the yield strength reduces: after tempering 𝜎𝑦 ≈ 450 - 800 MPa • the fracture toughness significantly increases. As the tempering time increases, the Fe3C precipitates coarsen, giving a steady fall in strength. The tempering temperature also influences the softening rate (faster diffusion means faster coarsening), and the volume fraction of precipitates formed (from the phase diagram). temper quench This is due to the microstructural changes that takes place during tempering: • The carbon in supersaturated solid solution diffuses to form Fe3C precipitates. • The Fe lattice changes from martensite to its equilibrium state: undistorted BCC. 21 The fine-scale dispersion of carbides in tempered martensite provides excellent precipitation hardening. It results in a yield strength 2-3 times greater than slow cooled (normalised) steel, but with comparable fracture toughness. Component cross-sections can therefore be reduced (saving weight), or design loads increased. For further details see experiment M2.

Measures of hardenability: • TTT diagram: the time taken for diffusive phase transformations to begin (e.g. ferrite, pearlite C-curves). higher hardenability = longer transformation times • CCT diagram: the critical cooling rate, the slowest cooling rate that gives 100% martensite (i.e. just missing the nose of the C-curves). higher hardenability = slower CCR • The largest bar diameter that will give 100% martensite at its centre after quenching: higher hardenability = larger diameter Heat flow analysis is used to relate cooling rate and component geometry. Standard geometries are used to characterize the response of different steels: e.g. long cylinders, quenched in water, oil or air. When do you want a steel with high hardenability? • When you want to form martensite easily, typically when you want to quench and temper the steel, e.g. for cutting tools (you need high hardness and toughness). • High hardenability means a larger component can be “through hardened”, i.e. forming martensite through the whole cross-section that can then be tempered. • High hardenability also means a component of a given size can be cooled more slowly (e.g. by air cooling) while still achieving 100% martensite. This gives much lower thermal stress, reducing thermal distortion and the risk of quench cracking (noting that martensite is brittle). 22 When do you want a steel with low hardenability? • When you do not want to form martensite on cooling, for example: welding. • Fusion welding involves traversing a heat source (flame, arc or laser) along the joint line between two components • The thermal cycle will form austenite in the heat affected zone (HAZ) close to the weld metal (the region that melts); this could form martensite on cooling. • In this context, forming martensite is undesirable – it is brittle, risking weld failure by fast fracture. high hardenability = poor weldability Factors affecting the hardenability of steels: (1) Carbon concentration: • Increasing the C content increases the hardenability, by delaying the diffusional phase transformations (see above). • However, the effect is relatively weak: even eutectoid steel requires a bar diameter < 30mm (water quenched) to form 100% martensite in the centre. Heat-treatable steel components can be considerably larger than this. (2) Further alloying: • This increases the hardenability by delaying the diffusional phase transformations. • If up to 5 wt% of various alloying elements (Ni, Cr, Mo, V, W) are added, these are known as low alloy steels. low alloy steel alloy additions • For the γ → α phase transformation to take place, these alloying elements need to be rearranged by diffusion (as they have a different solubility in FCC austenite vs BCC ferrite). • This diffusion of substitutional solute elements takes time, and hence shifts the C- curves to longer times. hypo-eutectoid steel 23 High alloy steels for cutting tools: • As well as needing high hardenability (to allow quenching and tempering) tools for high-speed metal-cutting often operate at high temperatures (due to the heat generated by plastic deformation). • In plain C steel, the Fe3C precipitates may coarsen (or re-dissolve), leading to softening. To prevent this, high alloy steels are used (containing Mo, W and V – up to 20 wt% in total). These elements perform multiple functions: • increasing the hardenability; • the quench and temper treatment also leads to the formation of alloy carbides (Mo2C, W2C, VC) – these are stable at high temperatures, retaining precipitation hardening in service; • contribute to high temperature solid solution hardening. 24 3.7 Summary of the learning outcomes: heat treatment of steels After completing section 3 you will be able to do the following: 1. Use the phase diagram to explain the microstructure, and hence properties, of slow cooled steel. 2. Use the TTT diagram to explain the effect of transformation temperature and time on the microstructure and properties of steel. 3. Describe the microstructure and properties that result from quenching and tempering steel. 4. Explain what is meant by the ‘hardenability’ of steel, why it is important in steel processing, and how it can be influenced. 25 Now attempt: Examples Paper 4, Q.2-4 3.8 Quiz W5.2: heat treatment of steels Three steel samples are compared: Sample A: 100% pearlite, hardness HV 260 Sample B: 50% pearlite and 50% ferrite, hardness HV 210 Sample C: 100% martensite, hardness HV 650 Which of the following statements are correct (more than one can be correct)? 1) A is harder than B because it has been cooled more rapidly. 2) C is harder than A because it has a higher carbon concentration. 3) C has the highest hardness because it has undergone a displacive rather than a diffusive phase transformation. 4) A, B and C can be tempered to increase their ductility.

Diffusion in heat treatment processes Diffusion plays an important role in heat treatment processes. Two specific examples will be considered in this section: • Modelling thermal history: As noted in the previous sections, the heat treatment of metal alloys is dependent on thermal history, in particular the cooling rates. There are direct parallels between the diffusion of atoms (covered in earlier lectures) and the conduction of heat. Analogous solutions to the diffusion equations can therefore be applied. Before proceeding, we will recap some key diffusion results from earlier lectures. The 1D flux of atoms (atoms s-1 m-2) is given by Fick’s first law: 𝐽 = −𝐷 𝜕𝐶 𝜕𝑥 where 𝐶(𝑥) is the concentration, and 𝐷 = 𝐷0 exp(−𝑄/𝑅𝑇) is the diffusion coefficient, which is dependent on the temperature, 𝑇. The governing equation for unsteady 1D diffusion is Fick’s second law: 𝜕𝐶 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷 𝜕2𝐶 𝜕𝑥2 which can be solved to find the concentration variation with position and time, 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡). Two solutions have been presented so far. (1) “Impulse response”: normal (or Gaussian) distribution: 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝑛0 2 𝜋𝐷𝑡 exp − 𝑥2 4𝐷𝑡 This has the following properties: • It tends to a delta function as t → 0, and has a standard deviation 2𝐷𝑡 . • The constant 𝑛0 is set by the initial conditions: it is the total number of atoms per unit area (i.e. the area under the curve) which remains constant for all values of 𝑡 . • Surface hardening: In many practical heat treatment problems, we want to achieve different properties for the surface compared to the bulk of a component. For example, to deliver improved wear resistance, without compromising component toughness. Surface hardening processes depend on both the diffusion of atoms and the diffusion of heat. 27 (2) “Step response”: error function (erf) distribution: 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐶1 erf 𝑥 2 𝐷𝑡 This has the following properties: • The value of erf ∞ = 1 and erf 0 = 0 . • 𝐶 𝑥, 𝑡 tends to a step function of amplitude 𝐶1 as 𝑡 → 0, and tends to zero as 𝑡 → ∞ . • The ‘width’ of the step is of the order 𝐷𝑡 . • Note that this solution can be re-scaled to the case with non-zero concentration at 𝑥 = 0 , i.e. 𝐶 𝑥 = 0, 𝑡 = 𝐶0 . In the following, we will make use of a third solution of the diffusion equation: when the initial conditions are a sinusoidal function. 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡 = 0) = 𝐶1 sin 2𝜋𝑥 𝑤 𝐶 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝐶0 + (𝐶1 − 𝐶0) erf 𝑥 2 𝐷𝑡 To solve this, take a trial solution of the form: 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐶1𝑓(𝑡) sin 2𝜋𝑥 𝑤 Here, 𝑓(𝑡) is an unknown time- dependent amplitude. Substituting this trial solution into Fick’s second law: 𝜕𝐶 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷 𝜕2𝐶 𝜕𝑥2 ⇒ This has the solution: 𝑓 𝑡 = exp −𝑡/𝜏 , 𝜏 = 𝑤2/4𝜋2𝐷 Therefore, a solution to the diffusion equation with sinusoidal initial conditions is: 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐶1 sin 2𝜋𝑥 𝑤 exp − 4𝜋2𝐷𝑡 𝑤2 This solution can also be rescaled for the case where 𝐶 𝑥 = 0, 𝑡 = 𝐶0, i.e. 𝐶 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝐶0 + (𝐶1−𝐶0) sin 2𝜋𝑥 𝑤 exp − 4𝜋2𝐷𝑡 𝑤2 𝑑𝑓 𝑑𝑡 + 𝐷 2𝜋 𝑤 2 𝑓 = 0 28 4.1 Modelling thermal history So far, we have looked at the diffusion of atoms. However, by comparing this with heat transfer by conduction, we can show that the governing equations are the same. Therefore, the same solutions can be used, with a change of variables. diffusion of atoms 𝐶 = concentration (atoms m-3) Fick’s first law: 𝐽 = atom flux (atoms s-1 m-2 ) 𝐷 = diffusion coefficient (m2 s-1 ) thermal conduction 𝑇 = temperature (K) Fourier’s law: 𝑞 = heat flux ( W m-2 ) 𝜆 = thermal conductivity ( W m-1 K-1) 𝐽𝛿𝑡 − 𝐽 + 𝜕𝐽 𝜕𝑥 𝛿𝑥 𝛿𝑡 = 𝛿𝐶𝛿𝑥 ∴ 𝜕𝐶 𝜕𝑡 = − 𝜕𝐽 𝜕𝑥 = 𝐷 𝜕2𝐶 𝜕𝑥2 𝐽 = −𝐷 𝜕𝐶 𝜕𝑥 𝑞 = −𝜆 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑥 Conservation of mass: net flow of atoms in = change in concentration x volume Conservation of energy: net flow of energy in = mass x specific heat capacity x change in temperature 𝑞𝛿𝑡 − 𝑞 + 𝜕𝑞 𝜕𝑥 𝛿𝑥 𝛿𝑡 = 𝜌𝛿𝑥 𝑐 𝛿𝑇 ∴ 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑡 = − 1 𝜌𝑐 𝜕𝑞 𝜕𝑥 = 𝜆 𝜌𝑐 𝜕2𝑇 𝜕𝑥2 𝑐 = specific heat capacity (J kg-1 K) 𝜆/𝜌𝑐 = 𝑎 = thermal diffusivity (m2 s-1) The governing equations for mass and thermal diffusion have the same form. The solutions are therefore interchangeable, with the change of variables: • concentration 𝐶 for temperature 𝑇 • diffusion coefficient 𝐷 for the thermal diffusivity 𝑎 (note that these have the same units, m2 s-1) 29 4.2 Example: thermal history of a quenched plate Consider quenching a steel plate of thickness 𝐿, from a uniform initial temperature 𝑇1, into a large bath of liquid at temperature 𝑇0 . • If we assume perfect heat transfer, the boundary condition at the surfaces is: 𝑇 = 𝑇0 for 𝑥 = 0, 𝐿 for all times 𝑡 ≥ 0 • Also, assume the plate is large, so heat flow is 1D: 𝑇(𝑥, 𝑡). The aim is to find a solution for 𝑇(𝑥, 𝑡) . This in turn can be used to provide information on cooling rates, and hence the likely phase transformations. Case 1 – thick plate limit If we assume that dimension 𝐿 is much larger than the distance over which heat can diffuse (i.e. for short times, a low thermal diffusivity material or a very thick plate), we can treat the plate as effectively infinite in thickness. • Recall that a ‘representative’ diffusion distance for atoms in time 𝑡 is given by: 𝐷𝑡 • The equivalent distance for thermal diffusion is given by: 𝑎𝑡 • So, the thick plate limit is reasonable when: 𝐿 ≫ 𝑎𝑡 The initial conditions are therefore a step function, with amplitude (𝑇1 − 𝑇0), and 𝑇 𝑥 = 0, 𝑡 = 𝑇0. The correct solution for this problem is therefore the error function, scaled to these initial conditions: We can use this to calculate the cooling rates in the plate (e.g. to see where martensite may form). From the materials data book: 𝑇 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝑇0 + (𝑇1 − 𝑇0) erf 𝑥 2 𝑎𝑡 𝑑 𝑑𝑍 erf 𝑍 = 2 𝜋 exp −𝑍2 Taking 𝑍 = 𝑥/2 𝑎𝑡 and 𝜕 𝜕𝑡 [ ] = 𝑑 𝑑𝑍 𝜕𝑍 𝜕𝑡 : 𝜕𝑇 𝑥, 𝑡 𝜕𝑡 = − 𝑇1 − 𝑇0 𝑡 𝑥 2 𝜋𝑎𝑡 exp − 𝑥2 4𝑎𝑡 𝑇1 − 𝑇0 = 100 °C 30 Case 2 – finite width plate A different solution is required if the thermal diffusion distances are significant compared to the plate thickness: 𝐿~ 𝑎𝑡 The way to solve this is to model the initial conditions as the first half wavelength of a square wave function. This can then be expressed as a Fourier series: a sum of sinusoidal functions. Each term in that sum can be solved using the sinusoidal solution outlined above. wavelength + + higher modes = The equivalent square wave parameters for the plate quenching problem are: • wavelength 2𝐿 (but only over the domain of one half wavelength: 0 < 𝑥 < 𝐿), • mean temperature of 𝑇0 , • mean-to-peak amplitude scaled to the temperature difference (𝑇1−𝑇0) . Hence, the initial conditions can be described by the Fourier series in 𝑥 : (Maths Databook – note the change of variable from time 𝑡 to a Fourier series in 𝑥) 𝑇 𝑥, 𝑡 = 0 = 𝑇0 + 𝑇1 − 𝑇0 ෍ 𝑛=1,3,5,… 4 𝑛𝜋 sin 𝑛𝜋𝑥 𝐿 31 To find a solution to the diffusion equation for these initial conditions, consider each sinusoidal term in the summation separately. Term 𝑛 has initial conditions : 𝑇𝑛 𝑥, 𝑡 = 0 = 𝑇1 − 𝑇0 4 𝑛𝜋 sin 𝑛𝜋𝑥 𝐿 Next, find a solution that satisfies this initial condition. As before, take a trial solution: If each term is a solution to the diffusion equation, then the sum will also be a solution. The end result is therefore: Here, 𝑓𝑛(𝑡) is the unknown time-dependent amplitude of mode 𝑛. Substituting this trial solution into the diffusion equation: 𝜕𝑇𝑛 𝜕𝑡 = 𝑎 𝜕2𝑇𝑛 𝜕𝑥2 ⇒ This has the solution: 𝑓𝑛 𝑡 = exp − 𝑡 𝜏𝑛 𝑑𝑓𝑛 𝑑𝑡 + 𝑎 𝑛𝜋 𝐿 2 𝑓𝑛 = 0 𝑇𝑛 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝑇1 − 𝑇0 4 𝑛𝜋 𝑓𝑛 𝑡 sin 𝑛𝜋𝑥 𝐿 𝜏𝑛= 𝐿 2 𝑛2𝜋2𝑎 𝑇 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝑇0 + 𝑇1 − 𝑇0 ෍ 𝑛=1,3,5,… 4 𝑛𝜋 sin 𝑛𝜋𝑥 𝐿 exp − 𝑛2𝜋2𝑎𝑡 𝐿2 This result gives some insights into the plate quenching problem: (1) The time constant 𝜏𝑛 for each mode is dependent on the parameter 𝑳𝟐/𝒂 . Therefore, reducing the plate thickness 𝐿 will significantly increase cooling rates. (2) The time constant 𝜏𝑛 is also very sensitive to the mode number 𝒏 (with 𝑛 = 1, 3, 5, …). The higher modes will decay much faster. So, the solution can (after a short period) be well approximated by just the first term: 𝑇 𝑥, 𝑡 ≈ 𝑇0 + 𝑇1 − 𝑇0 4 𝜋 sin 𝜋𝑥 𝐿 exp − 𝜋2𝑎𝑡 𝐿2 32 4.3 Surface hardening Many steel components used in machinery (e.g. gears, bearings, tool edges) are subjected to high surface stresses, due to friction and sliding contact. Surface engineering is used to harden the surface of the component (‘case hardening’) to increase its hardness and wear resistance – without damaging the strength and toughness of the underlying steel This can be achieved using a combination of the following two processes, which both rely on diffusion: (1) Carburising: This technique involves immersing the steel at high temperature in a carbon-rich atmosphere (such as molten cyanide or nitrate salts). • Carbon diffuses into the surface of the component, prior to any heat treatment. • The higher C content increases the hardenability, making it easier to form a surface layer of martensite, which may then be tempered. • The higher C content will also make the martensite harder, due to the greater supersaturation with carbon. The microstructure of a steel (0.15 wt% C) that has been carburised and then quenched is shown below: extra carbon has diffused into the surface Lower wt% C: • low hardenability • high proportion of ductile ferrite Higher wt% C at surface: • higher hardenability • forms martensite on cooling Image: © DoITPoMS Micrograph Library, University of Cambridge (Dr R F Cochrane) 33 We will use the diffusion analysis to model process (1): carburising. • Consider a steel component with initial carbon concentration 𝐶0. • The component is placed in a carbon rich environment at high temperature, which results in a higher surface concentration, 𝐶𝑠 . • The surface concentration 𝐶𝑠 is assumed to remain constant (i.e. large carbon supply). • Carbon will diffuse into the surface of the steel component over time, at a rate dependent on temperature and time. C (x = 0, all t) = Cs time increasing C (all x, t = 0) = C0 The initial conditions are therefore an inverted step function, with amplitude (𝐶𝑠 − 𝐶0), shifted by an initial concentration 𝐶0. • The solution for these initial conditions was introduced earlier in the course (the pre- deposition stage in Si doping): 𝐶 𝑥, 𝑡 is a function of 1 − erf 𝑥/2 𝐷𝑡 . • Adding the offset 𝐶0 to that solution, and scaling the amplitude to (𝐶𝑠 − 𝐶0), gives: 𝐶 𝑥, 𝑡 = 𝐶0 + 𝐶𝑠 − 𝐶0 1 − erf 𝑥 2 𝐷𝑡 (2) Transformation hardening: This involves imposing a heat source to the surface, such that a thin layer is austen- itised, and then cooling it quickly to form a layer of martensite (which can then be tempered). • Surface heating may use a traversing flame, laser, or electron gun; or high frequency induction coils are used to induce surface eddy currents. • Air cooling may be sufficient to form martensite – or a water-quench can be used. 34 • The concentration 𝐶0 is the initial composition of the steel being hardened. • Assuming a carbon rich environment, 𝐶𝑠 will be the maximum amount of carbon that can be accommodated in solid solution at the carburising temperature. • This is set by the solubility limit of the steel at the carburising temperature, from the phase diagram. solubility range carburising temp. 𝐶0 𝐶𝑠 The only unknown now is 𝑡case. Tables in the Materials Data Book give values erf 𝑌 vs 𝑌. Hence, 𝑥case/2 𝐷𝑡case can be evaluated. After working out the diffusion coefficient 𝐷 = 𝐷0 exp(−𝑄/𝑅𝑇) at the carburising temperature 𝑇, the time 𝑡case can be found. We can use this solution to calculate the time required to achieve a particular ‘case depth’ for the case hardening process, i.e. a particular thickness of hardened layer: • The hardness of the steel will increase with the carbon concentration, 𝐶. • Hence, for case hardening, it is necessary to specifying a minimum concentration 𝐶min at a specified depth into the material: the case depth 𝑥case . • This will set the depth and minimum hardness of the hardened layer. 𝑥case Substituting these values into the solution above, the time 𝑡case to achieve this case depth is given by the relationship: 𝐶min 𝐶 𝑥 at the minimum carburising time erf 𝑥case 2 𝐷𝑡case = 1 − 𝐶min − 𝐶0 𝐶𝑠 − 𝐶0 Before this can be solved for 𝑡case, we need to evaluate the concentrations 𝐶𝑠 and 𝐶0. 35 Now attempt: Examples Paper 4, Q.5-6 4.5 Quiz W6.1: diffusion in heat treatment A large steel plate of thickness 𝑤 is taken from a furnace and quenched in water.
