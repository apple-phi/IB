The spectrum of f(t), which is real valued, is shown in the figure. Sketch the spectrum of the sampled signal when the sampling rate is i)3 kHz, ii) 4 kHz and iii) 6 kHz. What is the minimum sampling rate that will ensure perfect reconstruction of f(t) from its sampled sequence f(nT)? 2. † Determine and sketch the spectrum of the following signals: a cos[2π(fs + fo)t], a cos[2π(fs - fo)t] and a cos[2πfot] where and fo and fs are constant frequencies in Hz. Hence show that all three signals have identical spectra if they are sampled with a sampling frequency of fs Verify this fact directly by consideration of the sampled sequence f(n/ fs) in each of the three cases. ω 2π ×10 3 4π ×10 3 -2π ×10 3 -4π ×103 F(ω) 0 1 2 3.* Explain why, for any signal v(t), v(t) δ(t – nT ) = v(nT) δ(t – nT ) . If we sample v(t) with sampling interval T, then the sampled signal multiplied by T, which we call vs(t), can be written: vs(t) = T {... + v(−2T) δ(t+ 2T) + v(−T) δ(t+ T) + v(0) δ(t) + v(T) δ(t - T) + ...}. Show that the pulse broadening circuit shown has the impulse response shown in figure 2 delay T − OutputInput ∫ dτ -∞ t+ 1 T T t Impulse Response 1 T Figure 2 Sketch the output signal ws(t) which results from passing the signal vs(t) through this circuit, and find its spectrum in terms of the spectrum V(ω) of the original signal v(t). Determine the ideal frequency response of a filter which can reconstruct v(t) from the pulse- broadened signal ws(t) (assuming that the maximum frequency component in v(t) is less than 1/(2T) Hz, where T is a known constant). 4.* A signal x(t) consists of a d.c. level plus two sinusoids x(t) = a0 + a1 cos ω0t + a2 cos 2ω0t, and it is sampled, without the use of an anti-aliasing filter, at a sampling frequency ωs given by ωs = k+1 0ω where k is a constant much smaller than 1. List the frequencies present in the sampled signal. The sampled signal is passed through an ideal low pass filter with cut-off frequency ωc equal to half the sampling frequency. Show that, since k is small, the output signal is proportional to a `stretched’ version x(bt) of the orginal signal, and determine b. [Background: A sampling oscilloscope uses this method to display periodic signals having bandwidths much larger than the bandwidth of a conventional oscilloscope amplifier. The signal to be displayed x(t) is sampled once per period but with a sampling time that is much larger than the period of the signal. Passing the sampled signal through a low pass filter will produce an output signal proportional to x(bt) where b < 1, i.e. the original signal is time stretched and is now within the bandwith of the oscilloscope amplifier.] 3 5.* The DTFT of a data sequence fn is defined as ∑ +∞ ∞− −= Tjn ns efF ωω)( where T is the sampling interval. Show that the sampled sequence fm may be obtained from the DTFT spectrum Fs(ω) using the following formula: ∫ + − += T T Tjm sm deF T f / / )( 2 π π ω ωω π Hint: substitute the definition for Fs(ω) into the formula and rearrange. You may use the following result: πθ π π θ 2=∫ − de jk if k=0, and zero for any other integer k. 6.† The data sequence (1,0,0,1) has been obtained by sampling a signal at 8 kHz. Calculate the DFT of this sequence, and use the inverse DFT to verify your answer. Plot the magnitude and phase of the DFT as a function of frequency, and comment on their symmetry properties. Use the DFT formulae to show that for any length N sequence fn: a) Fm =F-m * (for real valued signals) b) Fm+N=Fm 7.
