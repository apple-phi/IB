## A
One transistor—draws constant current from supply, irrespective of signal level. Therefore high inefficiency but low distortion.

## B
Two transistors—each conducts during only half-cycle so high efficiency but crossover causes distortion.

## AB
Two transistors—biased so each is on for longer than half a cycle to remove the crossover distortion.
