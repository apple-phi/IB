## Summary
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}&=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon} \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}&=0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E}&=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}  \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H}&=\mathbf{J}+\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} 
 \end{align}
$$

## Gauss’s Law
Charge produces an electric field which depending on the geometry and the permittivity.
$$
\begin{align}
\oint_{S}\mathbf{E}\cdot   \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} &=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon} \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}&=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon}
\end{align}
$$
where the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is generated by the potential energy $V$ as
$$
\mathbf{E}=-\nabla V
$$
Hence the electric field is everywhere orthogonal to surfaces of constant potential.

It is also common to alternatively express this in terms of the electric displacement field $\mathbf{D}$ defined as
$$
\mathbf{D}=\varepsilon \mathbf{E}
$$
for linear materials. This accounts for the polarization field.

Then the Gauss Law expressions are
$$
\begin{align}
\oint_{S}\mathbf{D}\cdot   \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} &=Q \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D}&=\rho
\end{align}
$$
## Gauss’s Law for magnetism
This states that magnetic monopoles don’t exist! There is no net flux through a closed surface.
$$
\begin{align}
\oint_{S}\mathbf{B}\cdot  \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} &=0 \\
\nabla \cdot\mathbf{B}&=0
 \end{align}
$$
## Maxwell-Faraday equation
Consider a (possibly moving) surface $\Sigma$ with boundary $\partial\Sigma.$ The flux through $\Sigma$ is
$$
\Phi_{B}=\iint_{\Sigma(t)}\mathbf{B}\cdot   \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} 
$$
while the circulating EMF around $\partial\Sigma$ is
$$
\mathcal{E}=\oint_{\partial\Sigma} \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\ell
$$
Applying Faraday’s Law then gives
$$
\begin{align}
\oint_{\partial\Sigma} \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\ell&=\iint_{\Sigma(t)}\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \cdot   \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E}&=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} 
 \end{align}
$$

## Ampère-Maxwell Law
Consider linear materials where
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{D}&=\varepsilon \mathbf{E} \\
\mathbf{H}&=\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mu}
 \end{align}
$$
Ampère wrote that
$$
\begin{align}
\oint_{C} \mathbf{H}\cdot  \mathrm{d}\ell&=I \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H}&=\mathbf{J}
 \end{align}
$$
but Maxwell noticed a flaw. Consider the counterexample of an Ampèrian loop taken around the gap of a capacitor. There is clearly both magnetic field and current, but Ampère’s Law says otherwise.

We correct this using a displacement current term.
$$
\begin{align}
\oint_{C} \mathbf{H}\cdot  \mathrm{d}\ell&=\iint_{S}\mathbf{J} \cdot  \,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} + \frac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H}&=\mathbf{J}+\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} 
 \end{align}
$$

## Free space transmission
For the free transmission of an $\mathrm{EM}$ wave through a dielectric, we have $\rho=\mathbf{J}=0.$ Therefore the Maxwell Equations are
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}&=0 \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}&=0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E}&=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}  \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H}&=\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} 
\end{align}
$$
From the electric curl we know
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{E}&=-\nabla \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\
&=-\mu\frac{\partial }{\partial t}(\nabla \times \mathbf{H})  \\
&=-\mu \frac{ \partial^{2} \mathbf{D} }{ {\partial t}^{2} }  \\
&=-\mu\varepsilon \frac{ \partial^{2} \mathbf{E} }{ {\partial t}^{2} } 
\end{align}
$$
Applying the vector calculus identities gives

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{E}&=\nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E})-\nabla^{2}\mathbf{E} \\
&=-\nabla^{2}\mathbf{E}
 \end{align}
$$
Hence, 
$$
\nabla^{2}\mathbf{E}=\mu\varepsilon \frac{ \partial^{2} \mathbf{E} }{ {\partial t}^{2} } 
$$
which is a wave equation with wave speed
$$
c= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \mu\varepsilon }}
$$
which is the speed of light for $\varepsilon_{r}=\mu_{r}=1.$

Similarly, the magnetic field varies as
$$
\nabla^{2}\mathbf{H}=\mu\varepsilon \frac{ \partial^{2} \mathbf{H} }{ {\partial t}^{2} } 
$$

The refractive index is defined as
$$
n=\frac{c}{c_{0}}=\sqrt{ \mu_{r}\varepsilon_{r} }
$$
But in many cases $\mu=\mu_{0}$ so we can often say that $n=\sqrt{ \varepsilon_{r} }.$

>Define a *plane wave* as a wave that propagates in a specific direction and that is uniform in the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction.

## Perpendicular fields
Consider the plane wave solution for $\mathbf{E},$ travelling in the $z$-direction and polarised in the $x$-direction.
$$
\mathbf{E}=E_{0}e^{ j(\omega t-\beta z) }\hat{\mathbf{x}}
$$
From the Maxwell-Faraday equation we can state that
$$
\begin{align}
-\nabla \times \mathbf{E}&=-\begin{bmatrix}
\partial_{x} \\
\partial_{y} \\
\partial_{x}
\end{bmatrix}\times \begin{bmatrix}
E_{0} \\
0 \\
0 
\end{bmatrix}e^{ j(\omega t-\beta z) } \\
&=j\beta E_{0}e^{ j(\omega t-\beta z) }\hat{\mathbf{y}}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} 
 \end{align}
$$
Hence the magnetic field is
$$
\mathbf{H}=H_{0}e^{ j(\omega t-\beta z) }\hat{\mathbf{y}}
$$
which is propagates with $\mathbf{E}$ but is polarised in the $y$-direction instead. Note that the amplitude is
$$
\begin{align}
H_{0}&=\frac{\beta}{\omega \mu}E_{0} \\
&= \frac{\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}}{2\pi f\mu}E_{0} \\
&=\frac{E_{0}}{\mu f\lambda} \\
&=\frac{E_{0}}{\mu c}
 \end{align}
$$
Hence the ratio of amplitudes of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ is
$$
\eta= \frac{E_{0}}{H_{0}}=\sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{\varepsilon} }
$$
which is defined as the impedance of the medium.

>This is the characteristic impedance of a [[transmission line]] with geometry factor $\mathfrak{g}=1.$


## Wave power and Poyting Vector
If a field occupies a volume of space, there must be potential energy stored. Hence $\mathrm{EM}$ fields transmit energy and must have an energy flux.

Define the Poynting vector $\mathbf{N}$ as
$$
\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{H}
$$
Note that $\hat{\mathbf{N}}$ is the wave direction and $|\mathbf{N}|$ is the time-varying instantaneous power density of the wave. For plane waves,
$$
\mathbf{N}=E_{0}H_{0}\cos ^{2}(\omega t-\beta z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$
If we sample $\mathbf{N}\big|_{z=0},$
![[plane-poynting-magnitude.png]]
The average energy flux is half the peak power so
$$
\begin{align}
\overline{ |\mathbf{N}|}&=\frac{1}{2}\braket{ \mathbf{E} \mid \mathbf{H} } \\
&=E\mathrm{_{rms}}H\mathrm{_{rms}}
 \end{align}
$$

## Antennas

### Broadcasting antennas

A very simple broadcasting antenna design is the half-dipole (grand plane) antenna. This is a conductor of height $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ sticking out of a ground plane. We apply an $\mathrm{AC}$ signal to generate an oscillating dipole and current (recall the method of images means there is an effective oppositve charge below the ground plane). These product an $\mathrm{EM}$ field. This wave will be preferentially transmissed int eh pkane of the ground (desireable).

![[ground-plane-antenna.png]]
Antennas always have this sort of anisotropy,

The antenna gain is
$$
G= \frac{|\mathbf{N}|_{\max}}{|\mathbf{N}|_{\mathrm{iso}}}
$$
Consider an antenna producing power $P.$ Isotropic radiation gives
$$
\overline{ |\mathbf{N}|}_{\mathrm{iso}}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}
$$
Then the maximum power density (i.e, in the desired propagation direction is)
$$
\overline{ |\mathbf{N}|}=G\overline{ |\mathbf{N}|}_{\mathrm{iso}}=\frac{GP}{4\pi r^{2}}
$$

![[ground-plane-power-density.png]]

Define the radiation resistance $R_{a}$ as the resistance that would have to be put in place of the transmitting antenna to dissipate the same power. 
$$
R_{a}=\frac{P}{I^{2}_{\mathrm{rms}}}
$$
where $I_{\mathrm{rms}}$ is the $\mathrm{RMS}$ current driving the antenna.

### Receiving antennas
We can also use the same simple dipole antennas for radio reception. Define the effective area $A_{e}$ as the area of $\mathrm{EM}$ wave that would give the same power $P_{\mathrm{abs}}$ absorbed by the antenna,
$$
A_{e}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{abs}}}{\overline{ |\mathbf{N}|}}
$$
This is the area that an ideal antenna would have to occupy the same power.

## Transmission through a conductor
The Maxwell equations for a conductor becomes
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{D}&=0 \\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}&=0 \\
\nabla\times \mathbf{E}&=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}  \\
\nabla\times \mathbf{H}&=\mathbf{J}+\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} 
\end{align}
$$
Define the conductivity $\sigma$ such that
$$
\mathbf{J}=\sigma \mathbf{E}
$$
Taking the curl of the Maxwell-Faraday equation gives
$$
\nabla\times \nabla\times \mathbf{E}=-\nabla\times \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} 
$$
As for free space / dielectric transmission, employ the identity $\nabla\times \nabla\times \mathbf{u}=\nabla(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u})-\nabla^{2}\mathbf{u}$ hence
$$
\begin{align}
\cancel{\nabla(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{E})}-\nabla^{2}\mathbf{E}&=-\frac{\partial }{\partial t} (\nabla\times \mathbf{B}) \\
\nabla^{2}\mathbf{E}&=\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \left( \mu\sigma \mathbf{E}+\mu\varepsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}  \right) \\
&=\mu\sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} +\mu\varepsilon \frac{ \partial^{2} \mathbf{E} }{ {\partial t}^{2} } 
 \end{align}
$$
this is very similar to the wave equation in a dielectric medium, except with an addition $\mu\sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$ term. For a plane wave in the positive $z$-axis, a solution to this wave equation is
$$
\mathbf{E}=E_{0}e^{ j\omega t-\gamma z }\hat{\mathbf{x}}
$$
where $\gamma$ is a complex propagation constant whose imaginary part describes the forwards propagation speed and whose real part describes the attenuation.

## The Skin effect
Substituting the plane wave solution into the wave equation for conducting media gives
$$
\gamma^{2}\mathbf{E}=j\omega \mu\sigma \mathbf{E}-\mu\sigma\omega^{2}\mathbf{E}
$$
Hence an expression for $\gamma$ is
$$
\gamma=\sqrt{ j\omega \mu(\sigma+j\omega\varepsilon) }
$$
If the material is highly resistive with $\sigma\ll\omega\varepsilon$ then
$$
\gamma=j\omega \sqrt{ \mu\varepsilon }
$$
which gives us non-attenuating forward propagation just like a dielectric, as expected.

Conversely, if the material is highly conductive with $\sigma\gg\omega\varepsilon$ then
$$
\gamma=\sqrt{ j\mu\omega\sigma }=\sqrt{ \frac{\mu\omega\sigma}{2} }(1+j)
$$
so the wave attenuates as $\exp\left( -z\sqrt{ \frac{\mu\omega\sigma}{2} } \right),$ with a characteristic length we call the *skin depth*.
$$
\delta= \frac{1}{\operatorname{Re}\gamma}=\sqrt{ \frac{2}{\mu\omega\sigma} }
$$
>Note that greater oscillation frequency of charge leads to faster energy loss, and hence a lower skin depth.

## Skin depth and transmission lines
At low frequencies, the skin depth is high compared to the line diameter so the wave is able to permeate through the entire cross section. Conversely, at high frequencies, the skin depth limits the wave to the surface of the [[transmission line]], so there is a locally high current density and hence a higher resistance.

![[resistance-skin-effect.png]]

>This is why optical fibres are preferred than copper wires for high speed data transmission.

## Intrinsic impedance of a conductive medium

Once again, the magnetic field is perpendicular to both the electric field and direction of propagation.
$$
\mathbf{H}=\overbrace{ \frac{\gamma}{j\omega \mu}}^{ H_{0} }e^{ j\omega t-\gamma z }
$$
This time, the intrinsic impedance is
$$
\eta= \frac{E_{0}}{H_{0}}=\sqrt{ \frac{j\omega \mu}{\sigma+j\omega\varepsilon} }
$$
which for $\sigma\ll j\omega \varepsilon$ simplifies to the dielectric case $\eta=\sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{\varepsilon} }.$ 

>However, since in general $\eta$ is complex, this implies a phase difference between the electric and magnetic fields.

For highly conductive materials with $\sigma\gg j\omega t,$
$$
\eta=\sqrt{ \frac{j\omega \mu}{\sigma} }=\sqrt{ \frac{\omega \mu}{2\sigma} }(1+j)
$$
Thus the magnetic field lags the electric field by $\frac{\pi}{4}.$

![[conducting-characteristic-impedance.png]]

>If we work out the magnitude of the characteristic impedance for a typical metal, such as copper, we find that it is much smaller than the characteristic impedances we have seen for dielectrics, so the wave is dominated by the magnetic field.

## Waves at conducting interfaces
Consider a wave normally incident on a boundary:
![[normal-incident-em-wave.png]]

Then the proportion of electric field that is transmitted across the boundary is
$$
\frac{E_{t}}{E_{i}}= \frac{2\eta_{2}}{\eta_{1}+\eta_{2}}
$$
so if $\eta_{2}\gg \eta_{1},$ for example a free space wave (like a Wi-Fi signal) entering a good conductor, then almost all the wave is reflected!

Even less highly conducting media is more highly reflecting. 

The conducting nature of sea water leads to reflecting of the $\mathrm{EM}$ wave at its surface. The wave is also significantly attenuated along its path, so communication with submarines is only possible when it is near the surface. This is why black box flight recorders have acoustic transmitters!
