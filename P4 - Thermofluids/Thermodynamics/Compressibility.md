The compressibility factor of a gas is defined as 
$$
Z\overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{pV}{nRT}
$$
In the limit as $p\to 0\Rightarrow Z\to 1$ and the gas behaves [[Perfect gas relationships|ideally]].
## Principle of corresponding states
van der Waals indicated that at the same *reduced pressure* and *reduced temperature*, all gases have the same compressibility and deviate from the ideal gas assumptions in approximately the same manner.

> *reduced*â€”fractionally relative to the [[PVT diagrams|critical point]] where gas is indistinguishable from liquid
