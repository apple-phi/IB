These are often written together as:
$$
\begin{align}
T\mathrm{d}S & =\mathrm{d}U+\delta W \\
 & =\mathrm{d}H-V\mathrm{d}p+{\delta W}_{\text{non-pressure}}
\end{align}
$$
This is valid under all conditions because all variables here are *state functions*.
## The First Law of Thermodynamics
The internal energy $U$ is the total kinetic and potential energy of the system.

When a system *receives* thermal heat $Q$ and *produces* work $W$, the internal energy varies according to: $$\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W$$If the work is due to pressure forces only, then:$$\delta W=p\mathrm{d}V$$

## The Second Law of Thermodynamics
Entropy is a state function quantifying disorder. The second law states that in a closed system, entropy must always increaseâ€”not all heat can be converted into work in a cyclic process.
### The Clausius theorem
$${\mathrm{d}S}_{\mathrm{sys}}\geq\frac{\delta Q}{T_{\mathrm{env}}}$$For a reversible process, $\delta Q=T\mathrm{d}S$.
