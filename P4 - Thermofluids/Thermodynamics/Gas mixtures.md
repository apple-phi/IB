Many of these laws are empirical and only apply to [[Perfect gas relationships|ideal gases]].
## Dalton’s Law
The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of its constituents, where the partial pressure is the pressure that a constituent would have if it was unmixed and occupied the volume at the same pressure,
$$
p=\sum p_{i}= \sum \frac{n_{i}}{n}p
$$
That is, the partial pressure is the mole-weighted fraction of net pressure.

## Amagat’s Law
The total volume is the sum of partial volumes of its constituents, where the partial volume is the volume that a constituent would have if it was unmixed and at the same pressure and temperature,
$$
V=\sum V_{i}=\sum \frac{n_{i}}{n}V
$$
## Energy conservation
The net energy in any form ($Q$, $U$, $H$, $S$)is the total of the energies of its components. If the components have their energies given as specific (i.e., per unit mass), then it is
$$
E=\sum E_{i}=\sum m_{i}e_{i}
$$
## Perfect gas constants
The specific gas constants ($c_{v}$, $c_{p}$, $R$) can also be calculated using a mass-weighted mean.
$$
c=\sum \frac{m_{i}}{m}c_{i}
$$
>Note that this does not apply to the ratio of specific heat capacities, $\gamma$ for which instead the net $\gamma-1$ is the mole-weighted harmonic mean of constituent values of $\gamma_{i}-1$
$$
\gamma-1= \left( \sum \frac{x_{i}}{\gamma_{i}-1} \right)^{-1} 
$$

where $x_{i}$ is the constituent mole fraction.
