Recall Fourier’s law relating heat flux density and temperature gradient,
$$
{\mathbf{q}}=-\lambda \nabla T
$$
where $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity. This is an empirical relationship.

Analogously with [[Fick's Laws]],
$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =\frac{\lambda}{\rho c} \nabla^{2}T
$$
See also: [[Thermal conduction]].
## Electrical analogue
Similarly to electrical engineering it is common to define the thermal resistance along a path through the material,
$$
R_{\theta}= \lambda \frac{L}{A}
$$
And also similarly this is the reciprocal of the thermal conductance.

> $Q$ is the analogue of charge, $\dot{Q}$ is the analogue of current, and $\Delta T$ is the analogue of potential difference.
$$
\Delta T=\dot{Q}R_{\theta}
$$
## Newton’s law of cooling
At a convective interface,
$$
\dot{{q}}=-h\Delta T_\text{wall / env}
$$
where $h$ the coefficient of heat transfer. The thermal resistance across a convective interface is
$$
R_{\theta}=\frac{1}{hA}
$$
