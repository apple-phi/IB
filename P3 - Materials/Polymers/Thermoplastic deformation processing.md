Plastic deformation of a polymer can be used both for shaping purposes, and to improve the [[Mechanical effects of thermoplastic crystallinity|mechanical properties]]. Amorphous or semi-crystalline thermoplastics near to $T_{g}$ have an elastic-plastic tensile response.

*Orientation strengthening* by stretching the polymer to align the chains significantly increases strength and stiffness.

Two processes which exploit this behaviour are fibre drawing and blow moulding.

## Fibre drawing
The bulk is drawn out through a screw extruder to align the chains through tension.

To demonstrate the effect on polyethene:

| Crystallinity | Youngâ€™s modulus / GPa |
| ---- | ---- |
| 40% | 0.2 |
| 80% | 0.7 |
| drawn fibre | 170 |

> Unlike bulk polymers, these polymer fibres can outperform all metals and some composites on a per weight basis ($\frac{\sigma_{f}}{\rho}$and $\frac{E}{\rho}$)

These drawn polymers are used to make e.g. Kevlar.

## Stretch blow moulding

This process creates a different molecular alignment in the longitudinal and hoop directions. Recall that $\sigma_{h}=2\sigma_{l}$ for pressure vessels.

The moulding temperature must be kept just above $T_{g}$ to restrict crystallinity (although some is desirable) otherwise it reduces the bottle transparency.

## Film blow moulding
Extruded polymer is inflated by internal pressure, cooled and wound onto a drum. This produces strong, light polymer films, e.g. for plastic shopping bags.
