Polymer crystallisation is dependent of temperature and time in a similar way to diffusion-depending phase transformations in metals, following C-curves with a similar [[Transformation diagrams#TTT (Time-Temperature-Transformation)|TTT]] diagram.

During cooling:
- Above $T_{m}$, the polymer is viscous, amorphous and stable
- From $T_{m}$ to $T_{g}$, the free energy released by the transformation into the crystalline state provides a *driving force* enhanced by [[Nucleation#Undercooling for nucleation|undercooling]]
- But crystallisation needs time for rearrangement by [[Fick's Laws|diffusion]] which occurs slower as it coolsâ€”this trade-off leads to the C-curves
- Below $T_{g}$, the van der Waals forces inhibit chain mobility and further crystallisation so the polymer is glassy

Crystallisation occurs by the [[Nucleation|nucleation]] of lamellar crystallites which grow radially out from the nucleus to form figures called *spherulites*.
