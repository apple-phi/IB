## Motivation
As well as [[Mechanical effects of thermoplastic crystallinity|effecting mechanical properties]], polymer crystallinity scatters light, hindering usage in applications requiring transparent polymers.

## Polymer selection
Polymers with significant numbers of monomer side groups inhibit diffusion and thus [[Thermoplastic crystallite formation|crystallite formation]].

## Cooling rates
Because crystallisation [[Thermoplastic crystallite formation|follows C-curves]], cooling faster than the critical cooling rate restricts time for diffusion.

This can be achieved by a narrow section thickness and/or mould chilling.
