Thermoplastics are polymers with no crosslinks that can be soften by heating. When shaping them, e.g. by injection moulding, it is important to [[Controlling thermoplastic crystallinity|control the degree of crystallinity]], which impacts the material properties.

## Density
- Crystalline regions have aligned chains so have a closer molecular packing
- So crystalline cooling leads to volumetric shrinkage
- The net density is the volume-weight mean of densities
## Youngâ€™s modulus
- Increases with crystallinity 
- If sufficiently crystalline, $E$ stays high past $T_{g}$ until the van der Waals forces in the crystallinity can be overcome
