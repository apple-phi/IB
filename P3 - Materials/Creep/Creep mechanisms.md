## Power-law dislocation creep
Dislocations can overcome obstacles and avoid work hardening by local [[Fick's Laws|diffusion]] which allows *dislocation climb*—where a segment of dislocation line diffuses only an alternative slip plan and continues gliding.

In this mechanism, the [[Creep modelling#Modelling|steady-state creep power law]] exponent is negative:
$$n=-5$$
Therefore this mechanism is very sensitive and is inhibited by applied stress.

## Diffusional flow creep
In this mechanism, entire grains elongate along the tensile axis by a combination of [[Diffusion mechanisms|diffusion mechanisms]]:
- diffusion along grain boundaries
- bulk diffusion through the crystal

The latter requires higher temperatures.

The [[Creep modelling#Modelling|steady-state creep power law]] exponent is 
$$
n=1
$$
So is not very sensitive to applied stress and is sometimes known as “linear viscous creep”.

However, it is sensitive to the grain size instead—smaller grains have a higher density of grain boundaries which facilitate diffusion.
