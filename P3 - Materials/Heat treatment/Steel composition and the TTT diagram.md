As the carbon composition increases:
- The ferrite fraction decreases and the carbide line rises to fully align with the pearlite start curve at the eutectoid composition.
- The C-curves spread out to accommodate the longer time it takes to diffusion to complete
- The martensite start and finish lines lower because the increased carbon increases the amount of lattice strain during the martensite transformation. This requires greater undercooling.

At the eutectoid, the martensite finish temperature has dropped all the way to -50Â°C so at room temperature there will still be a small fraction of unstable austenite.
