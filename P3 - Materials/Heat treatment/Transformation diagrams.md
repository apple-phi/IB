## TTT (Time-Temperature-Transformation)
To view the effects of temperature and reaction rate on material transformations within a single composition during an *isothermal* reaction, a TTT graph is used.

However, this only applies to isothermal processes so is not very useful for understanding the microstructure of other cooling conditions in practice.

## CCT (Continuous Cooling Transformation)
Similarly to the TTT graph, this shows the fraction transformed under a constant cooling rate.

This diagram also shows a critical cooling rate (CCR) for which (and for higher rates) the precipitation reaction does not happen due to insufficient time for nucleation.
