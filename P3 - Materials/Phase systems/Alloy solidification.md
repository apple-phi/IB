## Eutectic
The eutectic reaction is a three-phase reaction where a liquid transforms into two solid phases at constant temperature (see [[Phase diagrams]]). It is typically present in *casting* because of the low temperature requirement and a non-plastic melting range.

Because the temperature range is minimal, the diffusion distance must be minimal, so a lamellar microstructure forms. The free energy release compensates for the high surface energy (due to high surface area to volume ratio).

During further cooling, the small diffusion distances between the phases mean they purify by *interdiffusion*.

At non-eutectic compositions, the phase compositions during cooling change according to the [[Lever rule]]. In the hypo- and hyper- eutectic regions, the liquid phase approaches the eutectic.

## Pure iron
Consider the phase reaction of FCC $\gamma$-austenite to BCC $\alpha$-ferrite in the [[Iron-Carbon system]]:  $$\gamma\rightleftharpoons\gamma+\alpha\rightleftharpoons\alpha$$Upon cooling, the nucleation of the $\alpha$ phase begins at the $\gamma$ phase boundaries where there is more space and disorder for the $\alpha$ phase to form. The $\alpha$ grains grow by interdiffusion across the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ phases within the original grain. The interface grows in the opposite direction to the interdiffusion.

Since there may be multiple $\alpha$ nucleation sites per $\gamma$ grain, the average $\alpha$ grain size will be smaller.

## Eutectoid
Consider the phase reaction of austenite to pearlite in the [[Iron-Carbon system]]:$$\gamma\rightleftharpoons\alpha+\textrm{Fe}_3\textrm{C}$$This transforms one solid into the eutectoid mixture of two others. Similarly to the phase change of of [[#Pure iron|pure iron]], the pearlite nucleates at the grain boundaries of the austenite, then extrudes out into the austenite. This forms a fine lamellar microstructure oriented in the growth direction.

The eutectoid lamellar microstructure is significantly finer than that of the [[#Eutectic|eutectic]] because it forms by solid-state diffusion with much lower permissible diffusion distances (carbon atoms diffuse by a single lamella on average). *The microstructure is so fine it may look like a single phase!*
