A look at a common [[Phase diagrams|two-phase system]]. The commonly used phase diagram is only for a *pseudo*-equilibrium, since the metastable phase cementite (iron carbide, Fe$_3$C) typically forms in preference to pure carbon due to the reaction mechanism.

The diagram only has practical applications up to 6.67% wt. C (the composition of pure cementite).

## Phases
| Phase | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| L | Liquid solution of C in Fe |
| $\delta$-ferrite | Solid solution of C in $\delta$-Fe. BCC crystal structure. Forms at high temperatures at compositions below the austenitic peritectic point. |
| $\gamma$-austenite | Solid solution of C in $\gamma$-Fe. FCC crystal structure. Forms at medium temperatures and can dissolve a lot of carbon. |
| $\alpha$-ferrite | Solid solution of C in $\alpha$-Fe. BCC crystal structure. Exists at room temperature. |
| Cementite (Fe$_3$C) | Iron carbide, a hard and brittle intermetallic compound. |
| Pearlite ($\alpha+$Fe$_3$C) | The austenitic eutectoid alloy |
| Ledeburite ($\gamma+$Fe$_3$C) | The eutectic alloy |
## Notable reactions
| Reaction | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Eutectic | $L\rightleftharpoons$ Ledeburite ($\gamma+$Fe$_3$C) |
| Eutectoid | $\gamma \rightleftharpoons$ Pearlite ($\alpha+$Fe$_3$C) |
| Peritectic | $L+\delta\rightleftharpoons\gamma$ |
## Martensite
A common metastable phase not shown on this diagram, formed by the rapid cooling of $\gamma$-austenite.

It has a distorted BCC lattice and forms lamellar grains.
## Common steels

| Compound | Composition | Properties | Application |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Cast iron | low carbon | hardness (wear resistance), tough, high maximum service temperature | brake discs |
| Mild steel |  |  |  |
| Stainless steel |  |  |  |
- Cast irons have a higher Carbon content than steels
