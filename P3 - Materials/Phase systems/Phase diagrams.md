## Aims
- To recognise the important features of binary phase diagrams, and to identify whether fields are single phase or two-phase
- To find the proportions and compositions of the equilibrium phases, at a given temperature and alloy composition. See [[Lever rule]].
## Examples
- [[Iron-Carbon system]]
- The eutectic composition of the Lead-Tin system was historically used for *solder* since the eutectic composition is low. But in 2006, the EU prohibited intentional lead in most consumer electronics. The eutectic composition is beneficial for solder since it sets quickly. Alloys used need to be resistant to corrosion.
## Intermediate compounds
- Compounds may form at impure compositions due to thermodynamic stability (lower free energy than a two-phase state)
- These are shown as a very thin vertical region
- Often displayed as a single vertical line since so thinâ€”but this is not physically accurate because there must be a single phase region between each two-phase region
- The width in the compound region comes from a tolerance to composition, e.g., by solid solution substitution
- If the compound is entirely metallic, it is **intermetallic**.
## Definitions
### Boundaries
| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Liquidus | Locus of temperatures above which a system is entirely liquid |
| Solidus | Locus of temperatures below which a system is entirely solid |
| Solvus | Boundary between homogenous and heterogeneous compositions |
 - For pure compounds: solidus = liquidus = "melting point"
 - Reactions across these boundaries are slow and reversible
### Points of interest
See also [[Alloy solidification]].

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Eutectic point | Lower limit of liquid region formed by intersection of liquidi, below which is a solid region |
| Eutectoid point | Lower limit of solid region formed by intersecting phase boundaries, below which is another solid region |
| Peritectic point | Upper limit of solid region formed by intersecting phase boundaries, above which is a region with a liquid phase |
| Peritectoid point | Upper limit of solid region formed by intersecting phase boundaries, above which is another solid region |
| Hyper-eutectic point | The entirely binary-phase compositions to the right of the eutectic point, with the liquid phase approaching the eutectic on cooling |
| Hypo-eutectic point | The entirely binary-phase compositions to the left of the eutectic point, with the liquid phase approaching the eutectic on cooling |
| Monotectic | Non-examinable |
