The lever rule determines phase composition of mixtures from the graphical proportions along a **weight percentage** scale (not an atomic percentage scale) in a [[Phase diagrams|phase diagram]].

- Can obtain the volume fraction from the weight fraction if the **phase densities** are known.

## Derivation
Consider a point with composition $C_p$ and compositions $C_\alpha$ and $C_\beta$ on either side of the tie-line. Let the weight fractions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the composition be $W_\alpha$ and $W_\beta$ respectively.

By mass conservation: $$W_\alpha + W_\beta = 1$$And the contributions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ must have compatible weight fractions to sum to the net composition: $$W_{\alpha}C_{\alpha}+W_{\beta}C_{\beta}=C_p$$Therefore:
$$\begin{align*}
W_\alpha=\frac{C_\beta-C_p}{C_\beta-C_{\alpha}}\\\\
W_\beta=\frac{C_p-C_\alpha}{C_\beta-C_{\alpha}}
\end{align*}
$$
