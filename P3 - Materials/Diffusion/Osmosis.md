## Summary
- A solute in low concentration behaves analogously in its configurational entropy to an ideal gas
- A solute in solution generates an entropic pressure called osmotic pressure
## Osmotic pressure
In the typical demonstration of a U-shaped tube with a partially permeable membrane and a solute imbalance, the equilibrium state is a difference in water height. Therefore, there must be some osmotic pressure on the water to cause this [[Fick's Laws|diffusion]].

By analogy with ideal gases, assuming a low solute concentration, the osmotic pressure $\pi$ is given by:$$\begin{align*}
\pi&= \frac{n}{V}RT\\
&= cRT
\end{align*}$$
This has many applications to natural (especially biological) processes!
## Depletion pressure
In a colloid or polymer suspension with two suspended plates, having the plates sufficiently close will generate an attractive pressure up to $\pi=cRT$ due to the concentration difference of the colloids.

This has applications to water purification:

By adding a sufficient number of non-toxic colloids, dirt particles can be forced to aggregate and sink.
