Of the 4 main diffusion mechanisms, two are “bulk” mechanism and two are “short-circuit” mechanisms. These mechanisms can be physically modelled using [[Fick's Laws]].
## Bulk interstitial diffusion
Small interstitial solute atoms moves between the interstitial sites in a crystal lattice. The atoms need to be small compared to those in the lattice to fit into the interstitial sites.
**Example:** C in Fe
**Rate:** Fast (many available interstitial sites)
## Bulk vacancy diffusion 
Substitutional solute atoms exchange places with a similarly-sized vacancy in the crystal structure.
**Example:** Zn in Cu
**Rate:** Slow (few available vacancies in the lattice)
## Short-circuit diffusion along grain boundaries
Grain boundaries have an open crystal structure so allow fast diffusion along the 2D grain plane.
**Rate:** Fast
## Short-circuit diffusion along dislocation cores
There is high atom spacing along a dislocation core so fast diffusion possible along the core line.
**Rate:** Fast
