## Summary
- Oxide layers form directly at the surface if thermodynamically favourable
- Oxide layers may be:
	- protective, stay at the metal surface, and grow parabolically ($\propto \sqrt{ t }$)
	- porous and volatile and grow with constant rate ($\propto t$)
- The parabolic case demonstrates how kinetics can limit thermodynamically feasible reactions

## The Deal-Grove model
By making basic assumptions about reactant availability and oxide geometry, the formation of $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ grows according to$$\tilde{h}=\sqrt{ \tilde{t}+1}-1$$for a suitable height scale $\tilde{h}$ and time scale $\tilde{t}$.

This predicts linear growth at short time scales and quadratic growth at large time scales (due to limited [[Fick's Laws|diffusion]]).
