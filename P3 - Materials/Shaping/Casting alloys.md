In practise, castings are typically performed on alloys instead of [[Casting metals|casting metals]].

The alloy choice may be influenced by its *processability*, especially when casting complex geometries using *near net shape* (no further shaping) castings. But alloy choice can influence the microstructure and negatively impact the mechanical properties.

## Alloy selection
Casting alloys often have a near-[[Alloy solidification#Eutectic|eutectic]] composition:
- low freezing temperature
- low freezing range (minimal plastic melting range)
But:
- brittle lamellae
- low toughness

These negative properties can be improved by [[Steel heat treatment|heat treatment]] and [[High alloy steels|further alloying]].

In the case of the [[Iron-Carbon system]], a $\mathrm{Mg}$ dispersion can cause the pure carbon graphite phase to form as spheres instead of flakes, which reduces the effective crack length and stress concentration. This treatment is known as *poisoning*.
