## Use cases
- Initial step after setting composition of liquid phase
- To easily produce complex shapes
- To carefully control the solidification process (e.g., monocrystals like $\mathrm{Si}$ wafers in microchips and $\mathrm{Ni}$ alloys in jet engines)

## Grain structure
Most metal solidification results in a polycrystal since multiple crystals form from a combination of homogeneous and heterogeneous [[Nucleation|nucleation]]. The grain shape and size depends on the principles of solidification phase transformation, especially the undercooling parameter.

### Chill zone
High cooling rate at mould wall so lots of heterogeneous nucleationâ€”small grains nucleate rapidly on top of each other.

### Columnar zone
As the temperature falls, preferentially-oriented columnar grains grow out into the bulk.

## Equiaxed zone
As the centre cools, crystals are able to start growing at random orientations both homogeneously and also heterogeneously on contaminants or inoculants. Due to the lower cooling rate there is still a low nucleation rate so the grain sizes are larger.

### Inoculants 
A small grain size:
- increases [[Hardening methods#Grain boundary hardening|grain boundary hardening]]
- ensures uniform composition

A small grain size can be achieved by a fine dispersion of inoculants which act as sites for heterogeneous nucleation. E.g., $\mathrm{TiB_{2}}$ is commonly used to inoculate $\mathrm{Al}$ alloys.
