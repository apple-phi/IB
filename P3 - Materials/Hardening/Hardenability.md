## Measurement
A key consideration for [[Steel heat treatment|steel heat treatment]] is hardenability—how easily the steel forms martensite on cooling.

A measure of high hardenability can be given by several parameters:
- Long transformation times on [[Transformation diagrams#TTT (Time-Temperature-Transformation)|TTT diagrams]]
- Shallow critical cooling rate on [[Transformation diagrams#CCT (Continuous Cooling Transformation)|CCT diagrams]]
- Large maximum bar diameter that still produces 100% martensite at its centre upon quenching

## Desirability of high hardenability
- To form tempered martensite for tools (e.g. cutting tools) that need high hardness and fracture toughness
- For large components that need to be *through-hardened* to form tempered martensite throughout the whole cross-section
- Allows tempered martensite to still be formed by slower cooling, which reduces thermal stress, thermal distortion and risk of quench cracking (which is a risk due to martensite’s brittleness)

## Desirability of low hardenability
- In un-tempered contexts where brittleness is undesirable—e.g., in fusion welding, austenite can form in the *heat-affected zone* (HAZ) which can lead to a brittle weld upon cooling to martensite. This leads to poor *weldability*.

## Increasing hardenability
### Carbon composition
A higher carbon composition delays pearlite formation during [[Steel composition and the TTT diagram|quenching]] due to an increased diffusion time. However, this does not have a very large impact—even eutectoid steel has a maximum bar diameter of 3 cm when forming 100% martensite in the centre upon quenching.
### Additional alloying
This diffusion time can be further delayed by further alloying elements ($\mathrm{Ni}$, $\mathrm{Cr}$, $\mathrm{Mo}$, $\mathrm{V}$ & $\mathrm{W}$). If up to 5% wt. of these are added, the material is termed a *low alloy steel*. This works because the $\gamma\to\alpha$ transformation changes the solubility of the additional alloying elements so they must be rearranged by diffusion.
