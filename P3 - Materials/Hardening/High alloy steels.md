In some contexts, a low amount of additional [[Hardenability#Additional alloying|alloying elements]] is insufficient. Large amounts of additional alloying has several benefits:
- Higher [[Hardenability|hardenability]]
- Increased [[Hardening methods#Solid solution hardening|solid solution hardening]]
- Increased [[Hardening methods#Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardening]]
- Coarsening prevention

The latter two are due to the formation of hard alloy carbides ($\mathrm{Mo_{2}C}$, $\mathrm{W_{2}C}$, $\mathrm{VC}$) which maintain their precipitation hardening at high temperatures. This acts in contrast to cementite precipitates, which have a tendency to soften due to coarsening or re-dissolving at high temperatures.

These are especially useful for tools used in high-speed metal cutting (that generates heat through plastic deformation).
