## Instantaneous centre
Given a rigid body, if the non-parallel motion of two points stationary relative to the body are known, then it is possible to calculate the instantaneous centre about which the body rotates without linear motion.

## Velocity diagrams
Taking any stationary motion as being at the origin, a velocity diagram shows the relative motion of different points. This works because of vector additivity, e.g.
$$
\mathbf{v}_{3 /1}=\mathbf{v}_{3 /2}+\mathbf{v}_{2 /1}
$$
## Velocity image
The velocity vectors of a rigid body have the same geometric relation as the position vectors, but with a $+90^{\circ}$ rotation in the $\overset{\curvearrowleft}\omega$ direction.

## Acceleration image
The acceleration vectors of a rigid body have the same geometric relation as the position vectors, but at a rotation that depends on the angular velocity.

## Planar vectorial mechanics
The general result for differentiation of a vector rotating at $\omega$,
$$
\dot{\mathbf{r}}= \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} +\boldsymbol{\omega}\times \mathbf{r}
$$
where $\frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ is the derivative when $\omega=0$
