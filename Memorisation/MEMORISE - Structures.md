The shear strain $\gamma$ of a shear process is the angular deformation of a right-angle. For example, for two layers separated by a gap $h$ who shear by a distance $d,$
$$
\gamma=\frac{d}{h}
$$
The energy dissipation per unit volume is
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} E}{\mathrm{d}V} =\tau \gamma=k\gamma=\frac{kd}{h}
$$
>For rigid-plastic materials (assumption) the shear stress is a constant plastic shear strength $k$ due to Tresca.
