New business populations are highly turbulent. A new industry typically follows the following dynamics for the number of businesses in the industry:
- Low (phase of pioneers)
	- most pioneers exit before population stabilises
- High (phase of followers)
- Decline (phase of consolidation)
	- Larger firms emerge from mergers

## What explains firm growth and profitability?
### Neoclassical theory
A firm desires to maximise profit, so there is a driving force towards the optimum firm size.

Important parameters:
- Long-run average cost (LRAC) curve—the average unit cost
- Minimum efficient scale (MES)—optimum size, i.e. the output level that the LRAC is minimised

![[LRAC-MES.png|600]]

Firms enter an industry small then grow to reduce long run average costs. As demand expands and dominant designs emerge for products, then larger scale production is more cost effective.

Changes in the shape of the LRAC curve can drive long term trends in an industry towards a varying optimum size.

### Non-neoclassical theory

Demand is also a driving force for growth, and some products are more easily scalable than others. Many firms try to diversify their product range to many similar products (e.g. similar university degrees) to grow their consumer population.

Growth and profitability affect each other. As seen in the previous graph, growth is not always profitable—many firms reduce profitability by trying to grow too quickly—many profitable firms exist in niche markets and only grow in line with the market growth.

## Rolls-Royce: a case study on firm growth

The most important market for Rolls-Royce Plc is jet engine production for aviation. Aircraft engines have huge R&D costs, and require large production runs to recover this initial investment.

The company’s [[strategy]] reflects two key insights:
- Extension of initial investment so the engines can service a wide range of aircraft—increases chances of long-term relationships with plane manufacturers and airlines
- Fixed-price agreements for subsequent repair and maintenance—signals commitment to excellence and safety (vertical expansion into a related market)

Result:
- Increased orders
- Long term growth
- High volume of business
- R&D costs recouped

## Constraints on Firm Growth
The growth of the firm is determined by variations in
- Management skills
- Management objectives
- Available capital
- Technology
- Learning opportunities
- Market size
- Macroeconomic environment
- Luck!

Management development can constrain firm growth:

>*”If a firm […] expands its organization more rapidly than the individuals in the expanding organization can obtain the **experience** with each other and with the firm that is necessary for the effective operation of the group, the efficiency of the firm will suffer […] Since the services from ‘inherited‘ managerial resources control the amount of new managerial resources that can be **absorbed**, they create a fundamental and inescapable limit to the amount of expansion a firm can undertake at any time.”*—Penrose (1959)

Additionally, a possible problem is the trade-off between a firm's profit maximising growth and the managers’ wealth-maximising growth (Marris, 1963).

## Entry, innovation and industry growth
New firms in the economy challenge the monopolistic positions of larger firms through the introduction of new technologies and new strategies (J. Schumpeter, 1934).

New and small firms are more innovative and more adaptable than large firms. They require this strategic edge to survive in the same market as the monopolistic large firms.

## Small firms and job growth
Initially, empirical studies seemed to show that mall and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) make a contribution *more than proportional* to their relative size.

However, upon reappraisal, SMEs generate new jobs, but as many jobs may be lost among SMEs as are generated. SMEs do not have the resources to grow quickly, so new growth typically comes from newly formed SMEs, which are often spin-offs from larger firms already within the market.

## Growth skewness and heterogeneity
Distributions of growth rates and innovation are very skewed, with a small minority of firms responsible for most of the overall contribution of all SMEs to the economy. High-growth firms are disproportionately likely to be innovators.

However, this innovation is concentrated in approximately 20% of firms. While innovation is highly persistent through time at the firm level, firm growth is far less predictable an often akin to a random process.

Think Apple—which popularised the innovations of other companies.

## Industry dynamics and dominant designs

In a market’s infancy there is fluid growth and lots of experimentation, manifesting over time as very few dominant designs. The competition switches from innovation to cost-cutting.

This effect is most powerful in mass markets with *first mover effects*. This allows easy imitation by follower firms, which are able to appropriate the innovation of others, but dominate due to superiority in other factors—e.g., Apple

## Growth strategies
Most small firms are lifestyle firms where the owners are content not to grow the firm because they want to continue to be owner-managers, trading profit for control. E.g., Tom Scott.

Larger firms deliberately set out to strategically grow.

Firms can pursue internal expansion strategies such as differentiation by producing new products in-house. This can adapt prpoduct cahracterisitc to conquer the market share.

### Mergers and takeovers

Firms often choose rapid growth by external expansion via merger or takeover. In reality, these two strategies are not entirely diametrically opposed and have many shared characteristics.
![[mergers-takeovers.png]]
These are examples of external horizontal integration. Firms operating in the same stage of the industry combine to
- lower costs
- increase differentiation
- concentrate market power
- access new markets

### Growth by vertical integration
Instead of expanding within the same stage of the industry, firms can expand into adjacent stages of the product supply chains. E.g., Apple expanding into retail.

This has several benefits:
- Greater efficiencies (transaction view, coordination economies)
- Managerial economies
- Financial economies
- Reduced uncertainty

And several problems:
- Higher coordination cost
- Lack of flexibility (less diverse supplier pool)
- Incentive problems (lack of separate ownership and profit incentives)

One solution is to have tapered vertical integration. This has the benefits of
- Better cost information (understand the costs that external suppliers face)
	- More leverage over inside and outside production
- Lower capital if full integration later desired

However, this reduces the possibilities of economies of scale.

### Growth by diversification
Firms can merge with or takeover a diverse range of products. 

Benefits:
- Stability (risk spreading)
- Maintain growth beyond the initial market
