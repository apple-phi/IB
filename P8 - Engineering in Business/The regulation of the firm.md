## Markets and the role of government
Good governments aim to maximise social welfare (instead of private profit). This occurs when marginal social benefits (MSB) equals marginal social costs (MSC).

Private firms maximise profit by balancing marginal private benefit (MPB) with marginal private cost (MPC).

Governments intervene to correct market failure.

## Types of market failure
### Public goods
Public goods exhibit non-rivalry and non-excludability. This has a free-rider effect (anyone can access it for free) so the good would be undersupplied if left to the public sector. Governments often intervene to supply this using taxes / compulsory charges.

### Market power
Monopolists can raise prices and profits, reducing output such that too little of a good is produced (MSB>MSC). This is the deadweight social welfare loss under monopoly. Governments can intervene to stimulate output to prevent this.

### Ignorance / uncertainty
20% of electricity and gas consumers switch to more expensive products even when they thought they were cheaper. Small firms can be ignorant too, not knowing the best price-quality combinations of the products they buy. There is little incentive for large firms to create a market that supplies correct information. Governments can introduce compulsory information provision or advertisement regulation.

## Government intervention in the market
There is a divergence between social and private costs. The firm will ignore unpriced external production effects at $Q_{1}$, maximising its profit by setting MPB=MPC. But there are external costs of material, capital, and labour. To maximise social efficiency, MSC=$D$ (=MSB if all firm benefits are private with no externalities). Then $Q_{2}<Q_{1}$ but the government can correct this by taxing the firm so MPC$\to$MSC

Taxes and subsidies can be used to correct output reduction by subsiding production and taxing total profits (using a lump-sum tax). This can promote desirable activities in the firm (e.g., training and R&D). But it is often difficult (e.g. due to lack of market data) to use a different tax and subsidy rate to optimally account for the market distortion.

Governments can also change property rights (e.g. right to emit $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$). Firms can be forced to pay for the right to pollute. 

Regulatory bodies (e.g. Ofcom) can regulate pricing and promote competition to prevent monopoly and ensure optimal amounts of production.

Governments can require provision of information / product labelling.

They can also directly provide goods / services (e.g. public services, education etc.)

Governments can intervene in markets to stimulate competition, by competition policy on mergers, collusion and predatory pricing.

## The case for laissez-faire
Governments can easily miscalculate the optimal amounts of production (which a free market does automatically). They are less dynamic, slower to react, and hindered by bureaucracy. They introduce uncertainties (e.g. by shift in policy) that can accidentally restrict market growth. They may not always give people what they want (which in a sense the free market does) and they restrict individual freedoms.

Free markets automatically adjust to changes in private costs and benefits—capitalism is very dynamic! In reality there is a lot of competition even under monopoly/oligopoly, e.g. from other closely related markets, threats from international markets (to domestic monopolists). 

## What is competition policy?
Competition policy is government measures aimed at stimulating competition and protection against monopoly. 

There are two main view on this:
- Structuralist—lower concentration (lower firm level market shares) is better. I.e., monopoly is bad.
- Austrian—process of competition is the issue, not concentration per se. I.e., inability for competitors to enter market is bad (not monopoly per se)
## How is competition policy enforced?
There are three main approaches:
- The efficiency approach—examines how social surplus is effected by firm actions
- Public interest criteria—the impact on employment
- Competition testing—examines the extent of price reduction and choice being increased

In the UK this is enforced by the Competition and Markets Authority (aka. the MMC, CC, and OFT). It investigates and hears appeals about anti-competitive behaviour (via the Competition Appeals Tribunal). It was coordinated with EU competition policy which regulates pan-single market competition and sets the general stance of competition across the EU single market area. 

Other competition policies include:
- Deregulation (and privatisation) which allows entry into former monopolist markets
- Stimulation of innovation (to improve the competitive environment)

## Analysis of Abuse of Dominance
Predatory pricing is an example of abuse of dominance by an incumbent firm towards weaker rival firms.

>*”Predation is the deliberate acceptance of losses, with the intention of driving competitors out of business, and the expectation that it will be possible to earn supra-normal profits subsequently.”*—DGOFT, 95

In the UK, the identification of predation involves proving:
- feasibility
- activity loss—growth losses to the predator
- incremental loss—financial losses to the predator
- intent to predate

I.e., getting your prices wrong by accident and accidentally bankrupting a competitor is not predatory pricing.


## Analysis of Mergers
The 1960s believed that mergers that raised prices should be prevented. Consumer losses from higher prices are tradeable with the benefits to companies from lower costs. There is a naïve trade-off between company gains from efficiency and consumer losses from higher prices. This is the Williamson view of
>*”Scale economies as an anti-trust defence”*—Williamson

There are a number of important qualification to this view:
- take account for competition enforcement costs—investigation is costly!
- timing of costs and benefits—discounting of net present value of the stream of costs and benefits is needed
- incipiency argument—if each merger can be individually justified, we could still end up with a monopoly; you have the drawn the line somewhere on mergers
- mergers causing raised prices for customers of non-merging firms
- if technical progress speeds up or slows down
- if mergers lead to politically powerful lobbyists
- if mergers fall prey to managerialism
