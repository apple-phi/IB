## Empirical evidence
### Population of UK businesses
- 5.5 million businesses
- Most firms are actually self-employed one-person entities
- Most people work in firms with less than 250 employees
- Only about 8000 larger firms (>250 employees) but they:
	- Employ 40% of all business employment
	- Produce around half of all turnover

- The chance of a business being financially viable is ~42% after 5 years
- Although this only measures VAT-registered firms—the real failure rate could be higher!

## Theoretical perspectives
A firm is an organisation consisting of one or more individuals working as a decision-making unit to produce and distribute goods or services. This includes public sector firms like charities!

They can be:
- Unincorporated businesses such as sole proprietors (e.g., hairdressers, corner shops, law firm partnerships)
- Incorporated businesses:
	- Private limited companies (e.g. Virgin)
	- Public limited companies (stock market traded)
- Public sector (e.g. NHS)

The alternative to the firm is the market.

>*”The market is an institution for resource allocation which is based on horizontal voluntary exchanges by individual economic agents, who are motivated by preferences and price signals*—adapted from Pitelis (1999)

### Neoclassical theory of the firm
The firm is modelled as a production function which is optimised by profit. 

E.g., for a car production firm:

![[neoclassical-firm.png|500]]

This is convenient because it allows modelling behaviour and evolution of properties under certain assumptions, but this doesn’t explain the existence of the firm in the first place!

I.e., it treats the firm as a black box.

A contrasting view:
>*”[A firm is] an island of conscious power in this ocean of unconscious cooperation, like lumps coagulating in pail of buttermilk*—Dennis Robertson (1923)

### Transaction Cost theory
- Transaction costs are the cost of discovering prices and the cost of negotiating prices as well as making and enforcing contracts.
- This treats the firm and market as two alternative ways of carrying out transaction processes.

This assumes the intuition that markets are efficient resource allocators.

In the words of the person who came up with this:
>"*”A firm consists of the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on an entrepreneur*—Robert Coase (1937)

**tbc**

### The property rights view
>*”In a world of transaction costs and incomplete contracts, ex post residual rights of control will be important because, through their influence on asset usage, they will affect ex post bargaining power and the division of ex post surplus in a relationship. This division in turn will affect the incentives of actors to invest in that relationship.”*—Hart, O, (1989)

A firm is set in a world with transaction costs and incomplete contracts. In contrast to the Coasean view of the flexibility of employment contract, this view emphasises the importance of capital ownership.

Capital ownership:
- Carries *residual control rights* to take decisions in unpredicted/uncontracted  for situations
- Reduces the possibility of returns of particular investments being partially appropriated by other firms

**tbc**

### The Marxist view
The purpose of a firm is *not* efficiency of production and distribution but rather exploitation.
- It is an attempt by owners of capital to increase their share of the value added in production by reducing the shares going as wages.
**tbc**

### Managerial theories
- Separation between capital owners and managers
- There is a trade-off between managerial objectives (e.g. managerial costs, perks etc.) and shareholder objectives (that the firm produces profit).

Explains the size and growth of the firm, but not existence.

### Behavioural theories
- Bounded rationality and uncertainty make optimisation impossible.
**tbc**

### The capabilities approach
 Chandler (1992) wrote that the modern capitalist firm exist because it knows how to do certain things and can continue to exploit this ability as a competitive advantage
**tbc**

### Evolutionary theories
