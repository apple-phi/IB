## Perspectives on marketing
Marketing is not advertising / promotion, but about communicating the *vision* to the *customer*.

## Three levels of marketing
- Culture
- [[Strategy]]
- Tactics

## Culture

>*The difference between United and Amazon starts with its mission. Amazon’s mission is to be “earth’s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to by online.” United doesn’t have an explicit mission statement, but their customer commitment is to provide a “level of service to our customers that makes us a leader in the airline industry.”*

Amazon has an Empty Chair policy at all meetings to remind themselves to be customer-aware.

>*”We’re not competitor-obsessed, we’re customer-obsessed. We start with what the customer needs and we works backwards”*—Jeff Bezos

Galinsky’s $\mathrm{E}$ test—seeing things as the customer sess them.

## Strategic marking planning
1. Situation analysis
2. Segmentation
3. Targeting
4. Positioning
5. Marketing Mix
6. Execution

It is also important to consider $\mathrm{ESG}$—the environmental and social governance of a firm. 

### Analysis (the 5 Cs)
First perform a situation analysis of relevant socio-economic parameters.

- Customer
- Competitor
- Company
- Collaborators
- Context
- (Culture)
- (Legal)
- (Physical)

### Strategy (S-T-P)
Build the infrastructure before execution!
- Segmenting the market
	- Aggregate customers into groups with common needs who respond similarly to a marketing action.
- Targeting
- Positioning
	- Defining key value propositions based on customer needs

### Tactics (5 Ps)
Then take public-facing steps.

- Product
- Price
- Promotion
- Place (distribution)
- People

## Duality of product
There is a duality between emotional and rational consumer needs, but arguably, *all needs are fundamentally emotional.*

Just because you have a rationally excellent technology, that doesn’t mean it will be good as a consumed product.

## Customer needs
A customer doesn’t want a drill, they want a hole in their wall! A customer buys a product as a means to an actual benefit.

To understand consumer needs there are a few methods (there were 5 in the presentation):
- Survey
- Observation
- tbc
