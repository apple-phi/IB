# What is strategy?
[Porter's Generic Competitive Strategies (ways of competing)](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dstools/porters-generic-competitive-strategies/)
## Operational Effectiveness is not strategy
- Hyper-competition (arms race of best practice)
- Rapid diffusion of best practice
- Benchmarking → lack of distinctiveness

Porter argues that there should be an emphasis on a sustainable advantage that is *different* by not necessarily operationally better.

## Strategy rests on unique activities
Customer offerings should rest on capabilities, not marketing slogans. This is Porter’s “Strategic Position”.

This emerges from one or more of:
- Variety-based
	- Scope of activities to secure efficiency
- Needs-based
	-  Value chain tailored to needs to target customers
- Access-based
	- Geography
	- Scale

## Strategic position should
- Require choice
- Take priority over growth—deepen not deviate
- Derive from auditing
	- Where we are distinctive
	- Where we are profitable
	- Where our customers are satisfied
	- Which activities in the value chain are different and effective
## Sustainable strategic position rests on trade-offs
If your strategy is differentiated, you will be imitated.

To prevent this:
- Brand image
- Tight coordination and control
- Commitments (e.g. R&D is a barrier to entry)

Should avoid *straddling* between differentiation and maximum efficiency.
## Fit drives advantage and sustainability
No weakest link. Failing to choose undermines Fit.

Types of Fit:
- Simple consistency between activity and strategy
- Reinforcing activities
- Optimization of effort

The whole should be greater than the sum of its parts, by using synergy between activities and avoiding bottlenecks.

## Porter’s Five Forces
tbc

- Rivals
- Suppliers
- Customers
- New entrants
- Substitutes

Porter later added a 6th force—regulators.

The Five Force framework assesses an *industry*—it is a common category error to apply it to an individual firm.

- Strategies help mute the effect of forces.
- Weak forces are headroom to increase profits
- Strong forces are pain points which give rise to innovation (either by you or against you).
- Adjacent markets where the forces are weaker might be good places to shift / expand
- Adjacent markets where the forces are stronger might pose a risk.
## Addressing the Five Forces in competition
![[five-force-comp.png]]
## Pushing back against the forces
- **Rivals**—differentiate!
- **Suppliers** (incl. distributers, employees)—build a network, find alternatives
- **Customers**—create more value, raise switching costs, build an ecosystem
- **New entrants**—tie up distribution networks, make alliances not known to outside players
- **Substitutes**—if you can’t beat them, work with them!
## Porter’s generic strategies
|  | High production cost | Low production cost |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Most industry segments | Differentiation  | Cost leadership |
| Few industry segments | Focus  | Focus |

The *Focus* strategy was added later when Porter' revised his list of generic strategies.

## Integration / diversification and performance
A linear relationship has dominated research for the past 40 years:
- Sharing activities and resources leads to unit cost savings
- but generates cost of coordination compromise and inflexibility

The relationship of $\mathrm{performance}=f(\mathrm{diversification})$ follows an upside down U-shape. 
- Some diversification is better than none
- But need to avoid too much

## Defining competitive advantage
Porter’s 1980 analysis is still the dominant (and classical MBA) approach, but in the post-internet period new theories emerged.
### Porter (1980)
A unique configuration of activities allowing differentiated meting of customer needs and defensible position vis a vis competitors
- reinforce unique ness
- maintain differentiation

### Barney (1991)
A rare and hard-to-imitate resource or capability underlying the firm’s ability to compete.
- protect / reinforce the core
- spin it into growth opportunities

#### Adner (2012)
The ability to orchestrate a unique set of stakeholder relationship to achieve superior information flow
- build a unique ecosystem
- leverage it

### McGrath (2013)
The ability to spot and execute a series of temporary advantages
- be fast to enter
- be ready to exit

## Types of strategies
Positional, core, etc.

## Barney’s VRIO Framework
A sustained competitive advantage requires a product to have 4 qualities:
- Valuable
- Rare
- Inimitable
- Organised

### VRI resources
- Customer perception of the brand
- Enforceable IP
- Relationships
	- Especially when unusual combination of stakeholders
- Effective culture of execution
- Location
	- Physical
	- Digital platforms / vendor lock-in
- Unique capabilities
