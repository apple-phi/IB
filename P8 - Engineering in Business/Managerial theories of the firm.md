The managerial theories of the firm challenge the traditional assumption of profit maximization and provide alternative models of firm behaviour based on the separation of ownership and control in modern corporations.

## Marris' Model
- Developed by Robin Marris in the 1960s
- Assumes managers are motivated to maximize a utility function that depends on growth rate of firm's demand for its products and managerial job security
- Growth rate acts as a proxy for increasing managerial power, prestige, and salary
- Job security is a function of liquidity, leverage, and profit retention ratios
- Managers balance growth and security, subject to a minimum profit constraint to satisfy shareholders
- Predicts firms will pursue diversification strategies to increase growth rate[1][2]

## Williamson's Model of Managerial Discretion 
- Developed by Oliver Williamson in the 1960s
- Assumes managers have discretion to pursue their own utility rather than maximizing shareholder wealth
- Managers derive utility from staff expenditures, emoluments (economic rents), and discretionary investment funds
- But must maintain an acceptable profit level to ensure job security
- Predicts expense preference behaviour like excess staffing, higher salaries/perks for managers[3][4]

## Cyert and March's Behavioural Theory
- Developed in their 1963 book "A Behavioral Theory of the Firm"
- Views the firm as a coalition of individuals/groups (managers, workers, shareholders) with conflicting goals
- Firm aims to "satisfice" multiple goals like production, inventory, sales, market share, profits
- Goals are negotiated compromises, not strict maximization
- Bounded rationality and organizational slack play key roles in decision making processes[1][2][3]

These theories highlight the complexities of managerial motivation and decision making in large corporations. While criticized for lack of predictive power, they provide insightful alternatives to the profit maximization assumption.
