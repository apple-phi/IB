## Anatomy of the eye

- Cornea contributes most of the eye’s focusing power *but is fixed focus*.
- The crystalline lens sits behind the iris and contributes the remainder of the focussing power.
- The focal distance is dynamically changes by changing the shape of the lens using the ciliary muscles.

## Tissue structure

- functional building block of an organ.
- consist of cells and $\mathrm{ECM}$ (extracellular matrix—non-cell tissue)
- Connective tissues are
	- involved in structure / support
	- structurally dominated by ECM

- Fibroblasts are a kind of cell that is good at producing and destroying ECM

## Collagen
It is a polymer. In the eye:
- parallel bundles of similar size contribute to transparency in the cornea
- Sclera characterised by more random web
- Low solid density random gel network gives structural properties and  transparency of the vitreous.

## Cornea
- There is no blood supply to the cornea
- Crystalline collagen fibres create transparency
- Composite “basket-weave” design provides structural support

^^ The pink things are fibroblasts (specifically corneal keratocytes), which regulate the collagen.

The fibril orientation in the left and right eyes are mirror images of each other. The fibrils are directed towards the extra-ocular muscles at the edges.

## Lens

The capsule of the lens is also made of collagen-dominant connective tissue. Beneath the capsule is a layer of epithelial cells which acts as a source for the cortex and nucleus of new lens fibres with a specialised structure.

## Tissue biomechanics
Assuming collagen fibrils act as elastic springs, the non-linear elastic behaviour results from
- reorientation
- sequential recruitment of collagen fibrils

## Testing mechanical properties of corneal tissue

Hierarchy of scales—to measure bulk properties there is a trade-off between needing enough bulk material and large amounts of material being difficult to work with.

Expect:
- Nonlinear response
- Gradual stiffening in the inflation test
- Strip extensometry overestimates stiffness

### Tensile strain (extensometry) test of a strip
- From spherical surface, initial flattening adds initial compressive and tensile strains
- Corneal thickness increases further from the centre

![[strip-tensile-test.png|500]]
### Corneal inflation test
- More complication to do and analyse
