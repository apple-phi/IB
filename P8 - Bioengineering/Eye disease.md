## Lens accommodation
Focussing power comes primarily from the fixed-focus cornea and secondarily from the crystalline lens (which can change shape and hence focal length via the action of the ciliary muscles).

To see near, the ciliary muscles contract, rounding and thickening the lens. To see far, the ciliary muscles relax, applying tension to the ligaments.

The optical power $P$ is related to the focal length $f$ by
$$
P=\frac{1}{f}
$$
The amplitude of accommodation is the maximum variation in $P,$
$$
A=P_{\max}-P_{\min}
$$
Myopia is near-sightedness and hyperopia is far-sightedness. Hyperopia is related to presbyopia, which is common in late adults due to weakening of the ciliary muscles.

## Mechanical testing of Lens

Can use indentation test:
- Test 8 points across lens
- 3 rows (if possible)
- 1mm spacing
- Calculate shear modulus

$$
P= \frac{4RdG}{1-\nu}
$$

## Solving myopia

External lenses:
- glasses
- contact lenses

### Manufacturing contacts
Two solutions: spin casting and cast moulding.

Another solution is $\mathrm{LASIK}$ surgery.

### LASIK

Laser-Assisted *in Situ* Keratomileusis:
- Slice open cornea to expose stroma
- Use laser to vaporise regions of the stroma
- Close flap
	- It naturally adheres without sutures!

## Disease

![[eye-disease.png|400]]
### Cataracts
Cloudy, opaque lens. Leading cause of blindness.
- Associated with ageing

Solved by replacement of lens with an artificial intraocular lens.
### Glaucoma
Excess $\mathrm{IOP}$ causes damage to the optic nerve. Second most common form of blindness.

Solutions:
- Eye drops—slightly reduce $\mathrm{IOP}$ by increasing permeability
- Lasers
	- Trabeculoplasty—dilate the trabecular drainage tubes
	- Cyclodiode—destroy some tissues that produce the liquid
- Surgery (trabeculectomy)—remove part of the trabecular meshwork

### Corneal opacity
Cloudy, opaque cornea. Often due to injury, inflammation or infection—sudden onset!

Solved by corneal transplants, but this comes with problems:
- rejection risk
- induced glaucoma
- inflammation

Ongoing research into corneal tissue engineering—trying to grow new corneal tissue on scaffolds for transplant.
