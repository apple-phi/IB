## Recordings

Methods:
- Intracellular probes
- Extracellular probes
- Genetic engineering the cells to express proteins that can be more easily detected.

## Ganglion cells
Centre-surround receptive field, similar to a Laplacian convolution kernel, originally used to explain the Hermann grid illusion.

## V1

### Simple cells
Looks like oriented, localised Laplacian filter kernel, specifically the Gabor filter. Has a linear response summation (superposition) property of responses.

### Complex cells

Responds to contrasted, oriented stimuli, like the simple cells, but still activates when the stimuli is antiphase to the maximum stimuli (phase invariant, unlike the Gabor filter).

## Receptive field hierarchy 

![[rf-hierarchy.png|400]]

Central retinal cells map to much larger cortex proportions, primarily due to cortical magnification of the foveal area vs. peripheral areas.

## The cortex

V1 in columns of about 100 cells, which prefer specific orientations from one eye. Adjacent columns refer to adjacent retinal stimuli. “Hyper-columns” have long-range connections and can infer long-range patterns.

## Channel theory
Different feature resolutions are represented in independent channels (and merged in later processing stages).

E.g. blurry Marilyn Monroe superposed with the fine detail of Einstein. Zoom in and out to see or the other.

## Depth perception

Psychological cues:
- Relative size / Linear perspective
- Occlusion
- Shadow / illumination
- Texture gradients

Physiological cues:
- Accommodation & vergence
- Binocular disparity
- Motion parallax
