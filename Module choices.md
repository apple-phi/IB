In the end I ended up going with 3C5 3C6 3F3 3F1 4M12 3F2 3F7 3M1 3F8 3E1, which is pretty close to what I was initially going for as described below.

This qualifies me for the engineering areas of:
- Information and Computer Engineering
- Instrumentation and Control

>With these choices it is very easy to get Electrical and Information Sciences in 4th year

- Considering 3B2 (digital electronics, FPGAs) instead of 3B1
- Considering a bio module instead of 3B1.
- Considering taking 3B2 if taking 3B1 instead of 3E3 (but then would limit $\mathrm{IIB}$ areas)

>The titles of all the Engineering Areas for which you are qualified will appear on each of your third and fourth-year transcripts. It is likely – although not essential – that some of your Engineering Areas at Part IIB will be the same as that at Part IIA.

> It is not essential that your engineering area at Part IIB is the same as that at Part IIA.
